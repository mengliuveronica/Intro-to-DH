## Our Dataset: Pride and Prejudice üìö

For this chapter, we'll use Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" to demonstrate text analysis techniques. We'll access this novel using the `janeaustenr` package.

For this chapter, we'll use Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" to demonstrate text analysis techniques. To download the book dataset, run the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE}

pride_and_prejudice <- austen_books() %>%
  filter(book == "Pride & Prejudice")

pride_and_prejudice
```

Alternatively, you can also download it directly here:

[Download Pride and Prejudice dataset](data/pride_and_prejudice.csv)

You can create a folder named "data" in save the csv file in your working directorya and load the data with the following command:

```{r}
# Load required packages
p_load(readr)

# Now read the CSV file
pride_and_prejudice <- read_csv("data/pride_and_prejudice.csv")

pride_and_prejudice

```

This gives us the full text of "Pride and Prejudice" in a tidy format, with one line per row.


Before we dive into the technical aspects of preparing text for analysis, let's take a moment to think about how we interact with text in our everyday lives.

## Reflection

Imagine you're reading a book and taking notes for a literature class. You might underline important passages, write summaries in the margins, or create a list of key themes.

- What kinds of information do you focus on?
- What do you tend to ignore or skim over?
- How might your note-taking process change if you want to read hundreds of books instead of just one?

Take a few minutes to jot down your thoughts or discuss with a classmate. These reflections can help us understand the choices we make when preparing texts for computational analysis.

## Reflection Insights

When we read and take notes, we often:

1. Focus on: main ideas, character development, plot points, themes, and notable quotes.
2. Skim over: common words, detailed descriptions, or repetitive information.
3. For analyzing many books: we might create more structured notes, use consistent categories across books, and focus on comparing and contrasting elements.

These human reading strategies have parallels in computational text analysis:

- Focusing on key information ‚Üí Extracting features or topics
- Skimming common words ‚Üí Removing stopwords
- Structured note-taking ‚Üí Creating consistent data formats

As we explore text preprocessing techniques, we'll see how these human reading strategies are adapted for computational analysis.

Now, let's explore how computers "read" and prepare texts for analysis. This process, known as text preprocessing, is a crucial first step in quantitative text analysis.
