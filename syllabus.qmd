# 💪 Setting the Right Mindset
Remember these key points while you embark on your DH journey:
:::

### Embrace the Learning Curve {.unnumbered}

- Learning digital tools and methods is like learning a new language—it takes time and practice.
- Don't be discouraged by initial difficulties; everyone faces challenges when starting out.
- Celebrate small victories and progress along the way.

### Frustration is Part of Growth {.unnumbered}

- Feeling frustrated? Congratulations! It means you're pushing your boundaries and learning.
- Hadley Wickham (Father of modern R syntax) once said: "Everyone gets frustrated... I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming."
- Take breaks when needed, but don't give up. Return with fresh eyes and renewed determination.

### Cultivate Curiosity {.unnumbered}

- Approach new concepts with an open and inquisitive mind.
- Ask questions, explore beyond the course material, and let your curiosity drive your learning.
- Digital humanities is a field of endless possibilities—embrace the excitement of discovery.

### Build Resilience {.unnumbered}

- Expect challenges and setbacks—they're not roadblocks, but opportunities to problem-solve.
- Develop a growth mindset: view difficulties as chances to improve, not as personal shortcomings.
- Remember: every expert was once a beginner. Persistence is key to mastery.
