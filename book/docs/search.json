    "text": "Preface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This is the textbook for the course Introduction to Digital Humanities taught by Meng Liu, at the School of English and International Studies, Beijing Foreign Studies University.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Digital Humanities explores the intersection of humanities scholarship and digital methodologies. Students will learn how computational techniques can enhance humanities research, covering key concepts in digital humanities, modern R programming, and various analytical methods including quantitative text analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis. Through hands-on application of digital tools to humanities data, students will develop both technical skills and critical thinking abilities. The course progresses from foundational programming to advanced analytical techniques, concluding with discussions on ethics and AI in humanities scholarship. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a versatile toolkit for innovative, data-driven humanities research, suitable for those seeking to expand their methodological approach to cultural studies.\nThe content of the book is updated on a regular basis as the course progresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCredit: The content of the book is based on the following (amazing and highly acclaimed) sources:\n\nR for Data Science (2e)\nText Mining with R\n\n\n\nTo learn more about Quarto books visit https://quarto.org/docs/books.",
