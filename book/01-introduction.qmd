# What are Digital Humanities?

Digital Humanities (DH) is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution.

## Key Concepts

1. **Interdisciplinarity**: DH combines methodologies from traditional humanities disciplines with tools provided by computing.

2. **Data Analysis**: Large-scale analysis of cultural data sets.

3. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of humanities data.

4. **Digital Preservation**: Preserving cultural heritage through digital means.

In the next chapters, we'll dive deeper into these concepts and start exploring practical applications.
