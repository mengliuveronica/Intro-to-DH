Chapter 1,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession",Pride & Prejudice
"of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his,Pride & Prejudice
"first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds",Pride & Prejudice
"of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property",Pride & Prejudice
of some one or other of their daughters.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" said his lady to him one day, ""have you heard that",Pride & Prejudice
"Netherfield Park is let at last?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But it is,"" returned she; ""for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she",Pride & Prejudice
"told me all about it.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bennet made no answer.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Do you not want to know who has taken it?"" cried his wife impatiently.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
This was invitation enough.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken",Pride & Prejudice
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came,Pride & Prejudice
"down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much",Pride & Prejudice
"delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he",Pride & Prejudice
"is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to",Pride & Prejudice
"be in the house by the end of next week.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""What is his name?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Bingley.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Is he married or single?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or",Pride & Prejudice
"five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""How so? How can it affect them?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" replied his wife, ""how can you be so tiresome! You",Pride & Prejudice
"must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Is that his design in settling here?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he",Pride & Prejudice
"_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as",Pride & Prejudice
"soon as he comes.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send",Pride & Prejudice
"them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are",Pride & Prejudice
"as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the",Pride & Prejudice
"party.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but",Pride & Prejudice
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five,Pride & Prejudice
"grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into",Pride & Prejudice
"the neighbourhood.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""It is more than I engage for, I assure you.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would",Pride & Prejudice
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to,Pride & Prejudice
"go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no",Pride & Prejudice
"newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to",Pride & Prejudice
"visit him if you do not.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very",Pride & Prejudice
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my,Pride & Prejudice
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though,Pride & Prejudice
"I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the",Pride & Prejudice
"others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so",Pride & Prejudice
"good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""They have none of them much to recommend them,"" replied he; ""they are",Pride & Prejudice
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of,Pride & Prejudice
"quickness than her sisters.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You",Pride & Prejudice
"take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They",Pride & Prejudice
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration,Pride & Prejudice
"these last twenty years at least.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Ah, you do not know what I suffer.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four",Pride & Prejudice
"thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not",Pride & Prejudice
"visit them.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them",Pride & Prejudice
"all.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,",Pride & Prejudice
"reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had",Pride & Prejudice
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind,Pride & Prejudice
"was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,",Pride & Prejudice
"little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,",Pride & Prejudice
she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her,Pride & Prejudice
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 2,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He,Pride & Prejudice
"had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring",Pride & Prejudice
his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was,Pride & Prejudice
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following,Pride & Prejudice
"manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he",Pride & Prejudice
suddenly addressed her with:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"" said her mother",Pride & Prejudice
"resentfully, ""since we are not to visit.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But you forget, mamma,"" said Elizabeth, ""that we shall meet him at the",Pride & Prejudice
"assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces",Pride & Prejudice
"of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion",Pride & Prejudice
"of her.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""No more have I,"" said Mr. Bennet; ""and I am glad to find that you do",Pride & Prejudice
"not depend on her serving you.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain",Pride & Prejudice
"herself, began scolding one of her daughters.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little",Pride & Prejudice
"compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,"" said her father; ""she times",Pride & Prejudice
"them ill.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I do not cough for my own amusement,"" replied Kitty fretfully. ""When is",Pride & Prejudice
"your next ball to be, Lizzy?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""To-morrow fortnight.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Aye, so it is,"" cried her mother, ""and Mrs. Long does not come back",Pride & Prejudice
"till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,",Pride & Prejudice
"for she will not know him herself.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bingley to _her_.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him",Pride & Prejudice
"myself; how can you be so teasing?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly",Pride & Prejudice
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a,Pride & Prejudice
"fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,",Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as",Pride & Prejudice
"she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will",Pride & Prejudice
"take it on myself.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, ""Nonsense,",Pride & Prejudice
"nonsense!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"" cried he. ""Do",Pride & Prejudice
"you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on",Pride & Prejudice
"them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,",Pride & Prejudice
"Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read",Pride & Prejudice
"great books and make extracts.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""While Mary is adjusting her ideas,"" he continued, ""let us return to Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am sick of Mr. Bingley,"" cried his wife.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If",Pride & Prejudice
I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called,Pride & Prejudice
"on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we",Pride & Prejudice
"cannot escape the acquaintance now.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy",Pride & Prejudice
"was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the",Pride & Prejudice
while.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should",Pride & Prejudice
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to,Pride & Prejudice
"neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a",Pride & Prejudice
"good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a",Pride & Prejudice
"word about it till now.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,"" said Mr. Bennet; and,",Pride & Prejudice
"as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""What an excellent father you have, girls!"" said she, when the door was",Pride & Prejudice
"shut. ""I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;",Pride & Prejudice
"or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so",Pride & Prejudice
"pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but",Pride & Prejudice
"for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_",Pride & Prejudice
"the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next",Pride & Prejudice
"ball.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh!"" said Lydia stoutly, ""I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the",Pride & Prejudice
"youngest, I'm the tallest.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would,Pride & Prejudice
"return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to",Pride & Prejudice
dinner.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 3,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five",Pride & Prejudice
"daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her",Pride & Prejudice
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him,Pride & Prejudice
"in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and",Pride & Prejudice
"distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at",Pride & Prejudice
"last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,",Pride & Prejudice
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been,Pride & Prejudice
"delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely",Pride & Prejudice
"agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly",Pride & Prejudice
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of,Pride & Prejudice
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively,Pride & Prejudice
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,""",Pride & Prejudice
"said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, ""and all the others equally well",Pride & Prejudice
"married, I shall have nothing to wish for.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about",Pride & Prejudice
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being,Pride & Prejudice
"admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had",Pride & Prejudice
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more,Pride & Prejudice
"fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper",Pride & Prejudice
"window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already,Pride & Prejudice
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her,Pride & Prejudice
"housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley",Pride & Prejudice
"was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable",Pride & Prejudice
"to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite",Pride & Prejudice
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town,Pride & Prejudice
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that,Pride & Prejudice
"he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never",Pride & Prejudice
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears,Pride & Prejudice
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get,Pride & Prejudice
a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley,Pride & Prejudice
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.,Pride & Prejudice
"The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the",Pride & Prejudice
"day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only",Pride & Prejudice
six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when,Pride & Prejudice
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five,Pride & Prejudice
"altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and",Pride & Prejudice
another young man.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant,Pride & Prejudice
"countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,",Pride & Prejudice
"with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely",Pride & Prejudice
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention,Pride & Prejudice
"of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and",Pride & Prejudice
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes,Pride & Prejudice
"after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen",Pride & Prejudice
"pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he",Pride & Prejudice
"was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great",Pride & Prejudice
"admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust",Pride & Prejudice
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be,Pride & Prejudice
"proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all",Pride & Prejudice
his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most,Pride & Prejudice
"forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared",Pride & Prejudice
with his friend.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal,Pride & Prejudice
"people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,",Pride & Prejudice
"was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving",Pride & Prejudice
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for,Pride & Prejudice
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced,Pride & Prejudice
"only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being",Pride & Prejudice
"introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in",Pride & Prejudice
"walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.",Pride & Prejudice
"His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man",Pride & Prejudice
"in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.",Pride & Prejudice
"Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of",Pride & Prejudice
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his,Pride & Prejudice
having slighted one of her daughters.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit",Pride & Prejudice
"down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been",Pride & Prejudice
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.,Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend",Pride & Prejudice
to join it.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Come, Darcy,"" said he, ""I must have you dance. I hate to see you",Pride & Prejudice
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better,Pride & Prejudice
"dance.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am",Pride & Prejudice
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this,Pride & Prejudice
"it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not",Pride & Prejudice
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to,Pride & Prejudice
"stand up with.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I would not be so fastidious as you are,"" cried Mr. Bingley, ""for a",Pride & Prejudice
"kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in",Pride & Prejudice
my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see,Pride & Prejudice
"uncommonly pretty.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"" said Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one",Pride & Prejudice
"of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I",Pride & Prejudice
"dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Which do you mean?"" and turning round he looked for a moment at",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:",Pride & Prejudice
"""She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no",Pride & Prejudice
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted,Pride & Prejudice
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her,Pride & Prejudice
"smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth,Pride & Prejudice
"remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,",Pride & Prejudice
"however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,",Pride & Prejudice
"playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield,Pride & Prejudice
"party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been",Pride & Prejudice
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as,Pride & Prejudice
"her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's",Pride & Prejudice
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most,Pride & Prejudice
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been,Pride & Prejudice
"fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they",Pride & Prejudice
"had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good",Pride & Prejudice
"spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they",Pride & Prejudice
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With,Pride & Prejudice
a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a,Pride & Prejudice
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised,Pride & Prejudice
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on,Pride & Prejudice
the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a,Pride & Prejudice
different story to hear.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,"" as she entered the room, ""we have had a most",Pride & Prejudice
"delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.",Pride & Prejudice
"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well",Pride & Prejudice
"she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with",Pride & Prejudice
"her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her",Pride & Prejudice
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second,Pride & Prejudice
"time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand",Pride & Prejudice
"up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody",Pride & Prejudice
"can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going",Pride & Prejudice
"down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and",Pride & Prejudice
"asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,",Pride & Prejudice
"and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,",Pride & Prejudice
"and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""If he had had any compassion for _me_,"" cried her husband impatiently,",Pride & Prejudice
"""he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of",Pride & Prejudice
"his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively",Pride & Prejudice
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw,Pride & Prejudice
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
"Hurst's gown--""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any,Pride & Prejudice
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch,Pride & Prejudice
"of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some",Pride & Prejudice
"exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But I can assure you,"" she added, ""that Lizzy does not lose much by not",Pride & Prejudice
"suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at",Pride & Prejudice
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring,Pride & Prejudice
"him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very",Pride & Prejudice
"great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my",Pride & Prejudice
"dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 4,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in",Pride & Prejudice
"her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very",Pride & Prejudice
much she admired him.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""He is just what a young man ought to be,"" said she, ""sensible,",Pride & Prejudice
"good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much",Pride & Prejudice
"ease, with such perfect good breeding!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""He is also handsome,"" replied Elizabeth, ""which a young man ought",Pride & Prejudice
"likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I",Pride & Prejudice
"did not expect such a compliment.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between",Pride & Prejudice
"us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What",Pride & Prejudice
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help,Pride & Prejudice
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman,Pride & Prejudice
"in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is",Pride & Prejudice
"very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a",Pride & Prejudice
"stupider person.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Dear Lizzy!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.",Pride & Prejudice
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable,Pride & Prejudice
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your,Pride & Prejudice
"life.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak",Pride & Prejudice
"what I think.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_",Pride & Prejudice
"good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of",Pride & Prejudice
others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it,Pride & Prejudice
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the,Pride & Prejudice
"good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing",Pride & Prejudice
"of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,",Pride & Prejudice
"too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you",Pride & Prejudice
"converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep",Pride & Prejudice
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming,Pride & Prejudice
"neighbour in her.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at",Pride & Prejudice
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more,Pride & Prejudice
"quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,",Pride & Prejudice
"and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she",Pride & Prejudice
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine,Pride & Prejudice
"ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the",Pride & Prejudice
"power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and",Pride & Prejudice
"conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the",Pride & Prejudice
"first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand",Pride & Prejudice
"pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of",Pride & Prejudice
"associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect",Pride & Prejudice
"entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of",Pride & Prejudice
a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply,Pride & Prejudice
impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their,Pride & Prejudice
own had been acquired by trade.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred,Pride & Prejudice
"thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an",Pride & Prejudice
"estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and",Pride & Prejudice
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a,Pride & Prejudice
"good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those",Pride & Prejudice
"who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the",Pride & Prejudice
"remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to",Pride & Prejudice
purchase.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,",Pride & Prejudice
"though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no",Pride & Prejudice
"means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had",Pride & Prejudice
"married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider",Pride & Prejudice
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of,Pride & Prejudice
"age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation",Pride & Prejudice
"to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for",Pride & Prejudice
half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal,Pride & Prejudice
"rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it",Pride & Prejudice
immediately.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of",Pride & Prejudice
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the,Pride & Prejudice
"easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition",Pride & Prejudice
"could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he",Pride & Prejudice
"never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley",Pride & Prejudice
"had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.",Pride & Prejudice
"In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means",Pride & Prejudice
"deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,",Pride & Prejudice
"reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not",Pride & Prejudice
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley,Pride & Prejudice
"was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually",Pride & Prejudice
giving offense.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently,Pride & Prejudice
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or,Pride & Prejudice
prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive,Pride & Prejudice
"to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt",Pride & Prejudice
"acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not",Pride & Prejudice
"conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a",Pride & Prejudice
"collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for",Pride & Prejudice
"none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received",Pride & Prejudice
"either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,",Pride & Prejudice
but she smiled too much.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired,Pride & Prejudice
"her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one",Pride & Prejudice
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore,Pride & Prejudice
"established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such",Pride & Prejudice
commendation to think of her as he chose.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 5,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets,Pride & Prejudice
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade,Pride & Prejudice
"in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the",Pride & Prejudice
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.,Pride & Prejudice
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a,Pride & Prejudice
"disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;",Pride & Prejudice
"and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house",Pride & Prejudice
"about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,",Pride & Prejudice
"where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,",Pride & Prejudice
"unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all",Pride & Prejudice
"the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him",Pride & Prejudice
"supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By",Pride & Prejudice
"nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.",Pride & Prejudice
James's had made him courteous.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a",Pride & Prejudice
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest,Pride & Prejudice
"of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth's intimate friend.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over,Pride & Prejudice
a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly,Pride & Prejudice
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,"" said Mrs. Bennet with civil",Pride & Prejudice
"self-command to Miss Lucas. ""_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be",Pride & Prejudice
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he,Pride & Prejudice
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something,Pride & Prejudice
"about Mr. Robinson.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not",Pride & Prejudice
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton,Pride & Prejudice
"assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many",Pride & Prejudice
"pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his",Pride & Prejudice
"answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,",Pride & Prejudice
"beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as",Pride & Prejudice
"if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,"" said",Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte. ""Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,",Pride & Prejudice
"is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his",Pride & Prejudice
"ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite",Pride & Prejudice
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he,Pride & Prejudice
"sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"" said Jane.",Pride & Prejudice
"""I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he",Pride & Prejudice
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at,Pride & Prejudice
"being spoke to.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Miss Bingley told me,"" said Jane, ""that he never speaks much,",Pride & Prejudice
unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably,Pride & Prejudice
"agreeable.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very",Pride & Prejudice
"agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it",Pride & Prejudice
"was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had",Pride & Prejudice
"heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to",Pride & Prejudice
"the ball in a hack chaise.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,"" said Miss Lucas, ""but I",Pride & Prejudice
"wish he had danced with Eliza.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Another time, Lizzy,"" said her mother, ""I would not dance with _him_,",Pride & Prejudice
"if I were you.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""His pride,"" said Miss Lucas, ""does not offend _me_ so much as pride",Pride & Prejudice
"often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so",Pride & Prejudice
"very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,",Pride & Prejudice
"should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_",Pride & Prejudice
"to be proud.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""That is very true,"" replied Elizabeth, ""and I could easily forgive",Pride & Prejudice
"_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Pride,"" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her",Pride & Prejudice
"reflections, ""is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have",Pride & Prejudice
"ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human",Pride & Prejudice
"nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us",Pride & Prejudice
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some,Pride & Prejudice
"quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different",Pride & Prejudice
"things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may",Pride & Prejudice
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of,Pride & Prejudice
"ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,"" cried a young Lucas, who came with",Pride & Prejudice
"his sisters, ""I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of",Pride & Prejudice
"foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,"" said Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet; ""and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she,Pride & Prejudice
"would, and the argument ended only with the visit.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 6,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit,Pride & Prejudice
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on,Pride & Prejudice
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was,Pride & Prejudice
"found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,",Pride & Prejudice
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards,Pride & Prejudice
"the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest",Pride & Prejudice
"pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment",Pride & Prejudice
"of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;",Pride & Prejudice
"though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in",Pride & Prejudice
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It,Pride & Prejudice
"was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and",Pride & Prejudice
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference,Pride & Prejudice
"which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a",Pride & Prejudice
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it,Pride & Prejudice
"was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane",Pride & Prejudice
"united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a",Pride & Prejudice
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions,Pride & Prejudice
of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""It may perhaps be pleasant,"" replied Charlotte, ""to be able to impose",Pride & Prejudice
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be,Pride & Prejudice
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill,Pride & Prejudice
"from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and",Pride & Prejudice
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in,Pride & Prejudice
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every,Pride & Prejudice
"attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all",Pride & Prejudice
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are,Pride & Prejudice
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without,Pride & Prejudice
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_,Pride & Prejudice
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he,Pride & Prejudice
"may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can",Pride & Prejudice
"perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to",Pride & Prejudice
"discover it too.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal",Pride & Prejudice
"it, he must find it out.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane",Pride & Prejudice
"meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they",Pride & Prejudice
"always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that",Pride & Prejudice
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should,Pride & Prejudice
therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his,Pride & Prejudice
"attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for",Pride & Prejudice
"falling in love as much as she chooses.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Your plan is a good one,"" replied Elizabeth, ""where nothing is in",Pride & Prejudice
"question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined",Pride & Prejudice
"to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But",Pride & Prejudice
"these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,",Pride & Prejudice
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its,Pride & Prejudice
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four,Pride & Prejudice
"dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,",Pride & Prejudice
and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite,Pride & Prejudice
"enough to make her understand his character.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might",Pride & Prejudice
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must,Pride & Prejudice
remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four,Pride & Prejudice
"evenings may do a great deal.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they",Pride & Prejudice
both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other,Pride & Prejudice
"leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Well,"" said Charlotte, ""I wish Jane success with all my heart; and",Pride & Prejudice
"if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a",Pride & Prejudice
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a,Pride & Prejudice
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If,Pride & Prejudice
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or,Pride & Prejudice
"ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the",Pride & Prejudice
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to,Pride & Prejudice
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as,Pride & Prejudice
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your,Pride & Prejudice
"life.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not",Pride & Prejudice
"sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth",Pride & Prejudice
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some,Pride & Prejudice
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely,Pride & Prejudice
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the,Pride & Prejudice
"ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no",Pride & Prejudice
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly,Pride & Prejudice
"had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered",Pride & Prejudice
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To,Pride & Prejudice
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had,Pride & Prejudice
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry,Pride & Prejudice
"in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and",Pride & Prejudice
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those,Pride & Prejudice
"of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of",Pride & Prejudice
this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made,Pride & Prejudice
"himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough",Pride & Prejudice
to dance with.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing",Pride & Prejudice
"with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so",Pride & Prejudice
"drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were",Pride & Prejudice
assembled.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""What does Mr. Darcy mean,"" said she to Charlotte, ""by listening to my",Pride & Prejudice
"conversation with Colonel Forster?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see",Pride & Prejudice

"being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have",Pride & Prejudice
"any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such",Pride & Prejudice
"a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she",Pride & Prejudice
turned to him and said:,Pride & Prejudice

"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley",Pride & Prejudice
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were,Pride & Prejudice

"In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the",Pride & Prejudice

"would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive",Pride & Prejudice
"them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at",Pride & Prejudice
"least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage,Pride & Prejudice
"before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley",Pride & Prejudice
"and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them",Pride & Prejudice
"very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively",Pride & Prejudice
"resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the",Pride & Prejudice
"contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,",Pride & Prejudice
"she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at",Pride & Prejudice

"that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was,Pride & Prejudice
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work,Pride & Prejudice
on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was,Pride & Prejudice
"then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike",Pride & Prejudice
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so,Pride & Prejudice
"soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be",Pride & Prejudice
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where,Pride & Prejudice
she felt herself to be right.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at,Pride & Prejudice
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss,Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.",Pride & Prejudice
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration,Pride & Prejudice
"should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope",Pride & Prejudice
of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been,Pride & Prejudice
"suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight",Pride & Prejudice
"in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke",Pride & Prejudice
"ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were",Pride & Prejudice
"at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most",Pride & Prejudice
"conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.",Pride & Prejudice

"On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost",Pride & Prejudice

after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her,Pride & Prejudice

"tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of",Pride & Prejudice
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.,Pride & Prejudice

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet,Pride & Prejudice
"wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much",Pride & Prejudice
"trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their",Pride & Prejudice
"father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really",Pride & Prejudice
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The,Pride & Prejudice

very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's,Pride & Prejudice
"interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would",Pride & Prejudice
"resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his",Pride & Prejudice
"young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any",Pride & Prejudice
"affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared",Pride & Prejudice
for backgammon.,Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 15,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had",Pride & Prejudice
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part,Pride & Prejudice
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and,Pride & Prejudice
"miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he",Pride & Prejudice
"had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful",Pride & Prejudice
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had,Pride & Prejudice
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a,Pride & Prejudice
"good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in",Pride & Prejudice
"retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected",Pride & Prejudice
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de,Pride & Prejudice
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which,Pride & Prejudice
"he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,",Pride & Prejudice
"mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a",Pride & Prejudice
"clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of",Pride & Prejudice
"pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to",Pride & Prejudice
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had,Pride & Prejudice
"a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found",Pride & Prejudice
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.,Pride & Prejudice
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's,Pride & Prejudice
"estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and",Pride & Prejudice
"suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own",Pride & Prejudice
part.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face,Pride & Prejudice
"confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what",Pride & Prejudice
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled,Pride & Prejudice
"choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a",Pride & Prejudice
"quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a",Pride & Prejudice
"conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally",Pride & Prejudice
"to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at",Pride & Prejudice
"Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general",Pride & Prejudice
"encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. ""As to",Pride & Prejudice
"her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could",Pride & Prejudice
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her,Pride & Prejudice
"_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her",Pride & Prejudice
"to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon,Pride & Prejudice
"done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally",Pride & Prejudice
"next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have",Pride & Prejudice
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of,Pride & Prejudice
the day before was now high in her good graces.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister,Pride & Prejudice
"except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,",Pride & Prejudice
"at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,",Pride & Prejudice
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed,Pride & Prejudice
"him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with",Pride & Prejudice
"one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such",Pride & Prejudice
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been,Pride & Prejudice
"always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the",Pride & Prejudice
"house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,",Pride & Prejudice
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their,Pride & Prejudice
"walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker",Pride & Prejudice
"than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his",Pride & Prejudice
"cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of",Pride & Prejudice
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were,Pride & Prejudice
"immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and",Pride & Prejudice
"nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in",Pride & Prejudice
"a shop window, could recall them.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom",Pride & Prejudice
"they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking",Pride & Prejudice
with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was,Pride & Prejudice
the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came,Pride & Prejudice
"to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the",Pride & Prejudice
"stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,",Pride & Prejudice
"determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under",Pride & Prejudice
"pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately",Pride & Prejudice
"had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had",Pride & Prejudice
"reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated",Pride & Prejudice
"permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with",Pride & Prejudice
"him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a",Pride & Prejudice
commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the,Pride & Prejudice
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.,Pride & Prejudice
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of,Pride & Prejudice
"beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.",Pride & Prejudice
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness,Pride & Prejudice
of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and,Pride & Prejudice
unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together,Pride & Prejudice
"very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy",Pride & Prejudice
and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the,Pride & Prejudice
"ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and",Pride & Prejudice
"began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and",Pride & Prejudice
"Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to",Pride & Prejudice
Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated,Pride & Prejudice
"it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes",Pride & Prejudice
"on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the",Pride & Prejudice
"stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they",Pride & Prejudice
"looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.",Pride & Prejudice
"Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,",Pride & Prejudice
"after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just",Pride & Prejudice
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to,Pride & Prejudice
imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what",Pride & Prejudice
"passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's",Pride & Prejudice
"pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of",Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the,Pride & Prejudice
invitation.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,",Pride & Prejudice
"from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was",Pride & Prejudice
"eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as",Pride & Prejudice
"their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing",Pride & Prejudice
"about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the",Pride & Prejudice
"street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to",Pride & Prejudice
"Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility",Pride & Prejudice
was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She,Pride & Prejudice
"received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with",Pride & Prejudice
"as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous",Pride & Prejudice
"acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,",Pride & Prejudice
"however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who",Pride & Prejudice
introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an,Pride & Prejudice
excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon,Pride & Prejudice
"put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,",Pride & Prejudice
"however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a",Pride & Prejudice
lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the,Pride & Prejudice
"last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the",Pride & Prejudice
"occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the",Pride & Prejudice
"officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become ""stupid,",Pride & Prejudice
"disagreeable fellows."" Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses",Pride & Prejudice
"the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn",Pride & Prejudice
"would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips",Pride & Prejudice
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery,Pride & Prejudice
"tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such",Pride & Prejudice
"delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured",Pride & Prejudice
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass",Pride & Prejudice
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either,Pride & Prejudice
"or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain",Pride & Prejudice
such behaviour than her sister.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady",Pride & Prejudice
"Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;",Pride & Prejudice
"for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even",Pride & Prejudice
"pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although",Pride & Prejudice
"utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be",Pride & Prejudice
"attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so",Pride & Prejudice
much attention in the whole course of his life.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 16,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their,Pride & Prejudice
"aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for",Pride & Prejudice
"a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach",Pride & Prejudice
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and,Pride & Prejudice
"the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,",Pride & Prejudice
"that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in",Pride & Prejudice
the house.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much",Pride & Prejudice
"struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he",Pride & Prejudice
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast,Pride & Prejudice
parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much,Pride & Prejudice
gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what,Pride & Prejudice
"Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the",Pride & Prejudice
"description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found",Pride & Prejudice
"that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all",Pride & Prejudice
"the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison",Pride & Prejudice
with the housekeeper's room.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,",Pride & Prejudice
"with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and",Pride & Prejudice
"the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the",Pride & Prejudice
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive,Pride & Prejudice
"listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she",Pride & Prejudice
"heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as",Pride & Prejudice
"soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,",Pride & Prejudice
"and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine",Pride & Prejudice
"their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the",Pride & Prejudice
"interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.",Pride & Prejudice
"The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking",Pride & Prejudice
"of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.",Pride & Prejudice
"The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,",Pride & Prejudice
"gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and",Pride & Prejudice
"walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,",Pride & Prejudice
"breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was,Pride & Prejudice
"turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated",Pride & Prejudice
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into,Pride & Prejudice
"conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel",Pride & Prejudice
"that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered",Pride & Prejudice
interesting by the skill of the speaker.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the,Pride & Prejudice
"officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young",Pride & Prejudice
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind,Pride & Prejudice
"listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly",Pride & Prejudice
"supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he",Pride & Prejudice
"had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I know little of the game at present,"" said he, ""but I shall be glad",Pride & Prejudice
"to improve myself, for in my situation in life--"" Mrs. Phillips was very",Pride & Prejudice
"glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he",Pride & Prejudice
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there,Pride & Prejudice
"seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most",Pride & Prejudice
"determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,",Pride & Prejudice
"she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets",Pride & Prejudice
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.,Pride & Prejudice
"Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore",Pride & Prejudice
"at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear",Pride & Prejudice
"him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be",Pride & Prejudice
told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not,Pride & Prejudice
"even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly",Pride & Prejudice
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far,Pride & Prejudice
"Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in",Pride & Prejudice
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""About a month,"" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject",Pride & Prejudice
"drop, added, ""He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I",Pride & Prejudice
"understand.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes,"" replied Mr. Wickham; ""his estate there is a noble one. A clear",Pride & Prejudice
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more,Pride & Prejudice
"capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for",Pride & Prejudice
I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my,Pride & Prejudice
"infancy.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after",Pride & Prejudice
"seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting",Pride & Prejudice
"yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""As much as I ever wish to be,"" cried Elizabeth very warmly. ""I have",Pride & Prejudice
"spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very",Pride & Prejudice
"disagreeable.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I have no right to give _my_ opinion,"" said Wickham, ""as to his being",Pride & Prejudice
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him,Pride & Prejudice
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_,Pride & Prejudice
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general,Pride & Prejudice
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly,Pride & Prejudice
"anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in",Pride & Prejudice
"the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in",Pride & Prejudice
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find,Pride & Prejudice
"him more favourably spoken of by anyone.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I cannot pretend to be sorry,"" said Wickham, after a short",Pride & Prejudice
"interruption, ""that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond",Pride & Prejudice
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The,Pride & Prejudice
"world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his",Pride & Prejudice
"high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an",Pride & Prejudice
"ill-tempered man."" Wickham only shook his head.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I wonder,"" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, ""whether he is",Pride & Prejudice
"likely to be in this country much longer.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I",Pride & Prejudice
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will,Pride & Prejudice
"not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_",Pride & Prejudice
"wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,",Pride & Prejudice
"and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for",Pride & Prejudice
"avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense",Pride & Prejudice
"of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he",Pride & Prejudice
"is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men",Pride & Prejudice
"that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never",Pride & Prejudice
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by,Pride & Prejudice
a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been,Pride & Prejudice
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and,Pride & Prejudice
"everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the",Pride & Prejudice
"memory of his father.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with",Pride & Prejudice
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the",Pride & Prejudice
"neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that",Pride & Prejudice
"he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very",Pride & Prejudice
intelligible gallantry.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,"" he added,",Pride & Prejudice
"""which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be",Pride & Prejudice
"a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me",Pride & Prejudice
"further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great",Pride & Prejudice
attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.,Pride & Prejudice
"Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and",Pride & Prejudice
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.,Pride & Prejudice
"A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have",Pride & Prejudice
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I,Pride & Prejudice

"""Good heavens!"" cried Elizabeth; ""but how could _that_ be? How could his",Pride & Prejudice
"will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to",Pride & Prejudice
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the,Pride & Prejudice

"conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim",Pride & Prejudice
"to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain",Pride & Prejudice
"it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was",Pride & Prejudice
"of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no",Pride & Prejudice
"less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done",Pride & Prejudice
"anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and",Pride & Prejudice

been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal,Pride & Prejudice
"invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed",Pride & Prejudice
for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their,Pride & Prejudice
"dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly",Pride & Prejudice
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To,Pride & Prejudice
the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet,Pride & Prejudice

eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.,Pride & Prejudice

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every,Pride & Prejudice
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in,Pride & Prejudice
"compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered",Pride & Prejudice
"by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a",Pride & Prejudice
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the,Pride & Prejudice

Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.,Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look",Pride & Prejudice
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended,Pride & Prejudice
"less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they",Pride & Prejudice
"each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,",Pride & Prejudice
"he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball",Pride & Prejudice

"him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if",Pride & Prejudice
"he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's",Pride & Prejudice
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no,Pride & Prejudice
"scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke",Pride & Prejudice
"either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to",Pride & Prejudice
dance.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,"" said he, ""that a ball",Pride & Prejudice
"of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,",Pride & Prejudice
can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing,Pride & Prejudice
"myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair",Pride & Prejudice
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of,Pride & Prejudice
"soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,",Pride & Prejudice
a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right,Pride & Prejudice
"cause, and not to any disrespect for her.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being,Pride & Prejudice
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins,Pride & Prejudice
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help,Pride & Prejudice
"for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce",Pride & Prejudice
"delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as",Pride & Prejudice
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his,Pride & Prejudice
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first,Pride & Prejudice
"struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy",Pride & Prejudice
"of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a",Pride & Prejudice
"quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.",Pride & Prejudice
"The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing",Pride & Prejudice
"civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a",Pride & Prejudice
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than,Pride & Prejudice
"gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before",Pride & Prejudice
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage,Pride & Prejudice
"was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose",Pride & Prejudice
"to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the",Pride & Prejudice
"consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and",Pride & Prejudice
"till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the",Pride & Prejudice
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this,Pride & Prejudice
"time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there",Pride & Prejudice
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton,Pride & Prejudice
"once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very",Pride & Prejudice
shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have,Pride & Prejudice
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the,Pride & Prejudice
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than,Pride & Prejudice
"a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and",Pride & Prejudice
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in",Pride & Prejudice
"vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a",Pride & Prejudice
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty,Pride & Prejudice
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that,Pride & Prejudice
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than,Pride & Prejudice
"usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all",Pride & Prejudice
"that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than",Pride & Prejudice
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose,Pride & Prejudice
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's,Pride & Prejudice
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though,Pride & Prejudice
"this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was",Pride & Prejudice
"pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who",Pride & Prejudice
told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the,Pride & Prejudice
"day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,",Pride & Prejudice
"""I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if",Pride & Prejudice
"he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every",Pride & Prejudice
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate,Pride & Prejudice
"disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to",Pride & Prejudice
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.,Pride & Prejudice
"Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She",Pride & Prejudice
"was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away",Pride & Prejudice
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in,Pride & Prejudice
"speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect,Pride & Prejudice
"of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her",Pride & Prejudice
"spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had",Pride & Prejudice
"not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition",Pride & Prejudice
"to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular",Pride & Prejudice
"notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;",Pride & Prejudice
"they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,",Pride & Prejudice
"apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being",Pride & Prejudice
"aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable",Pride & Prejudice
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from,Pride & Prejudice
him was ecstasy.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances",Pride & Prejudice
"were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with",Pride & Prejudice
"her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took",Pride & Prejudice
"her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,",Pride & Prejudice
"without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again",Pride & Prejudice
"immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of",Pride & Prejudice
mind; Charlotte tried to console her:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I dare say you will find him very agreeable.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her",Pride & Prejudice
"hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a",Pride & Prejudice
"simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant",Pride & Prejudice
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no,Pride & Prejudice
"answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which",Pride & Prejudice
"she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and",Pride & Prejudice
"reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding",Pride & Prejudice
it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to,Pride & Prejudice
"imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at",Pride & Prejudice
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would,Pride & Prejudice
"be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made",Pride & Prejudice
"some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again",Pride & Prejudice
"silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time",Pride & Prejudice
"with:--""It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked",Pride & Prejudice
"about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size",Pride & Prejudice

"He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be",Pride & Prejudice
said.,Pride & Prejudice

"""Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be",Pride & Prejudice

"trouble of saying as little as possible.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you",Pride & Prejudice
"imagine that you are gratifying mine?""",Pride & Prejudice

"""Both,"" replied Elizabeth archly; ""for I have always seen a great",Pride & Prejudice
"similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,",Pride & Prejudice
"taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say",Pride & Prejudice
"something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to",Pride & Prejudice
"posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,""",Pride & Prejudice
"said he. ""How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_",Pride & Prejudice

"the temptation, added, ""When you met us there the other day, we had just",Pride & Prejudice
"been forming a new acquaintance.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his,Pride & Prejudice
"features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself",Pride & Prejudice
"for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a",Pride & Prejudice
"constrained manner said, ""Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners",Pride & Prejudice
as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of,Pride & Prejudice

"that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass",Pride & Prejudice
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.,Pride & Prejudice

inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of,Pride & Prejudice
"such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently",Pride & Prejudice
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way",Pride & Prejudice
before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I want to know,"" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her",Pride & Prejudice
"sister's, ""what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have",Pride & Prejudice
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case,Pride & Prejudice
"you may be sure of my pardon.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""No,"" replied Jane, ""I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing",Pride & Prejudice
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of,Pride & Prejudice
"his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have",Pride & Prejudice
"principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,",Pride & Prejudice
"the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that",Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has,Pride & Prejudice
"received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,",Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has,Pride & Prejudice
"been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am",Pride & Prejudice
"satisfied. But what does he say of the living?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard",Pride & Prejudice
"them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to",Pride & Prejudice
"him _conditionally_ only.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,"" said Elizabeth warmly;",Pride & Prejudice
"""but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but",Pride & Prejudice
"since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt",Pride & Prejudice
"the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of",Pride & Prejudice
"both gentlemen as I did before.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on",Pride & Prejudice
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with,Pride & Prejudice
"delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence",Pride & Prejudice
"in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew",Pride & Prejudice
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last,Pride & Prejudice
"partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,",Pride & Prejudice
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as,Pride & Prejudice
to make a most important discovery.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I have found out,"" said he, ""by a singular accident, that there is now",Pride & Prejudice
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the,Pride & Prejudice
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of,Pride & Prejudice
"the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady",Pride & Prejudice
Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have,Pride & Prejudice
"thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de",Pride & Prejudice
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made,Pride & Prejudice
"in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to",Pride & Prejudice
"do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total",Pride & Prejudice
"ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.",Pride & Prejudice
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to,Pride & Prejudice
"assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him",Pride & Prejudice
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction,Pride & Prejudice
"as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that",Pride & Prejudice
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either,Pride & Prejudice
"side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in",Pride & Prejudice
"consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her",Pride & Prejudice
"with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she",Pride & Prejudice
"ceased speaking, replied thus:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in",Pride & Prejudice
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your,Pride & Prejudice
"understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide",Pride & Prejudice
"difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,",Pride & Prejudice
"and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that",Pride & Prejudice
I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with,Pride & Prejudice
the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of,Pride & Prejudice
behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to,Pride & Prejudice
"follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to",Pride & Prejudice
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to,Pride & Prejudice
"profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant",Pride & Prejudice
"guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by",Pride & Prejudice
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young,Pride & Prejudice
"lady like yourself."" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose",Pride & Prejudice
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced,Pride & Prejudice
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of,Pride & Prejudice
"it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the",Pride & Prejudice
"words ""apology,"" ""Hunsford,"" and ""Lady Catherine de Bourgh."" It vexed",Pride & Prejudice
her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him,Pride & Prejudice
"with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time",Pride & Prejudice
"to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,",Pride & Prejudice
"was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed",Pride & Prejudice
"abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the",Pride & Prejudice
"end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I have no reason, I assure you,"" said he, ""to be dissatisfied with my",Pride & Prejudice
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered,Pride & Prejudice
"me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying",Pride & Prejudice
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be,Pride & Prejudice
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very,Pride & Prejudice
"handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned",Pride & Prejudice
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the,Pride & Prejudice
"train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,",Pride & Prejudice
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in,Pride & Prejudice
"that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection",Pride & Prejudice
"could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of",Pride & Prejudice
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts,Pride & Prejudice
"she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to",Pride & Prejudice
"venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to",Pride & Prejudice
"supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which",Pride & Prejudice
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find,Pride & Prejudice
"that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,",Pride & Prejudice
"openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon",Pride & Prejudice
"be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet",Pride & Prejudice
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the,Pride & Prejudice
"match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but",Pride & Prejudice
"three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and",Pride & Prejudice
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of,Pride & Prejudice
"Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as",Pride & Prejudice
"she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger",Pride & Prejudice
"daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of",Pride & Prejudice
"other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be",Pride & Prejudice
"able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that",Pride & Prejudice
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was,Pride & Prejudice
"necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on",Pride & Prejudice
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She,Pride & Prejudice
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally,Pride & Prejudice
"fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no",Pride & Prejudice
chance of it.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's,Pride & Prejudice
"words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible",Pride & Prejudice
"whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the",Pride & Prejudice
"chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her",Pride & Prejudice
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am",Pride & Prejudice
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say,Pride & Prejudice
"nothing _he_ may not like to hear.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you",Pride & Prejudice
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by,Pride & Prejudice
"so doing!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would",Pride & Prejudice
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and,Pride & Prejudice
blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently,Pride & Prejudice
"glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what",Pride & Prejudice
"she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was",Pride & Prejudice
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression,Pride & Prejudice
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and,Pride & Prejudice
steady gravity.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who",Pride & Prejudice
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no,Pride & Prejudice
"likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and",Pride & Prejudice
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of,Pride & Prejudice
"tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and",Pride & Prejudice
"she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,",Pride & Prejudice
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent,Pride & Prejudice
"entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,",Pride & Prejudice
but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of,Pride & Prejudice
"exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's",Pride & Prejudice
"eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her",Pride & Prejudice
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very,Pride & Prejudice
"ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks",Pride & Prejudice
"of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to",Pride & Prejudice
"favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.",Pride & Prejudice
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was,Pride & Prejudice
"weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at",Pride & Prejudice
"Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to",Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs",Pride & Prejudice
"of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,",Pride & Prejudice
imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his,Pride & Prejudice
"interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,",Pride & Prejudice
"and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, ""That will do",Pride & Prejudice
"extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other",Pride & Prejudice
"young ladies have time to exhibit.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid",Pride & Prejudice
her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""If I,"" said Mr. Collins, ""were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I",Pride & Prejudice
"should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an",Pride & Prejudice
"air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly",Pride & Prejudice
"compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,",Pride & Prejudice
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time,Pride & Prejudice
"to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The",Pride & Prejudice
"rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make",Pride & Prejudice
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not,Pride & Prejudice
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time,Pride & Prejudice
"that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care",Pride & Prejudice
"and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making",Pride & Prejudice
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance,Pride & Prejudice
"that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,",Pride & Prejudice
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit,Pride & Prejudice
him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an,Pride & Prejudice
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the,Pride & Prejudice
"family."" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had",Pride & Prejudice
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many,Pride & Prejudice
"smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his",Pride & Prejudice
"wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,",Pride & Prejudice
"and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably",Pride & Prejudice
"clever, good kind of young man.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to",Pride & Prejudice
"expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would",Pride & Prejudice
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or,Pride & Prejudice
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister,Pride & Prejudice
"that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his",Pride & Prejudice
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he,Pride & Prejudice
"must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should",Pride & Prejudice
"have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,",Pride & Prejudice
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the,Pride & Prejudice
"gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though",Pride & Prejudice
"he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her",Pride & Prejudice
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with,Pride & Prejudice
"somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.",Pride & Prejudice
"He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;",Pride & Prejudice
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to,Pride & Prejudice
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her,Pride & Prejudice
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed,Pride & Prejudice
"her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and",Pride & Prejudice
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;,Pride & Prejudice
"though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite",Pride & Prejudice
"disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the",Pride & Prejudice
"probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in",Pride & Prejudice
it.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by",Pride & Prejudice
"a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of",Pride & Prejudice
"an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how",Pride & Prejudice
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her,Pride & Prejudice
"sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and",Pride & Prejudice
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed,Pride & Prejudice
"every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a",Pride & Prejudice
"languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the",Pride & Prejudice
"long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his",Pride & Prejudice
"sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and",Pride & Prejudice
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said,Pride & Prejudice
"nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the",Pride & Prejudice
"rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a",Pride & Prejudice
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too,Pride & Prejudice
"much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of ""Lord,",Pride & Prejudice
"how tired I am!"" accompanied by a violent yawn.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly",Pride & Prejudice
"civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and",Pride & Prejudice
"addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he",Pride & Prejudice
"would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without",Pride & Prejudice
"the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,",Pride & Prejudice
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on,Pride & Prejudice
"her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next",Pride & Prejudice
day for a short time.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the",Pride & Prejudice
"delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of",Pride & Prejudice
"settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly",Pride & Prejudice
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four,Pride & Prejudice
"months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought",Pride & Prejudice
"with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the,Pride & Prejudice
"man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each",Pride & Prejudice
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 19,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his,Pride & Prejudice
"declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as",Pride & Prejudice
"his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having",Pride & Prejudice
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at,Pride & Prejudice
"the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the",Pride & Prejudice
"observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On",Pride & Prejudice
"finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,",Pride & Prejudice
"soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,",Pride & Prejudice
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the,Pride & Prejudice
"course of this morning?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet answered instantly, ""Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy",Pride & Prejudice
"will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I",Pride & Prejudice
"want you up stairs."" And, gathering her work together, she was hastening",Pride & Prejudice
"away, when Elizabeth called out:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse",Pride & Prejudice
me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am,Pride & Prejudice
"going away myself.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are."" And upon",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to",Pride & Prejudice
"escape, she added: ""Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Collins.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's,Pride & Prejudice
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it,Pride & Prejudice
"over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to",Pride & Prejudice
"conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between",Pride & Prejudice
"distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as",Pride & Prejudice
"they were gone, Mr. Collins began.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from",Pride & Prejudice
"doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You",Pride & Prejudice
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little,Pride & Prejudice
"unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected",Pride & Prejudice
mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the,Pride & Prejudice
"purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to",Pride & Prejudice
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as,Pride & Prejudice
"soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of",Pride & Prejudice
my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this,Pride & Prejudice
"subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for",Pride & Prejudice
"marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design",Pride & Prejudice
"of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away",Pride & Prejudice
"with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could",Pride & Prejudice
"not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,",Pride & Prejudice
and he continued:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for",Pride & Prejudice
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example,Pride & Prejudice
"of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will",Pride & Prejudice
add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought,Pride & Prejudice
"to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and",Pride & Prejudice
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling,Pride & Prejudice
patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked,Pride & Prejudice
too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I,Pride & Prejudice
"left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was",Pride & Prejudice
"arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you",Pride & Prejudice
"must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose",Pride & Prejudice
"a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,",Pride & Prejudice
"useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small",Pride & Prejudice
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as,Pride & Prejudice
"you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the",Pride & Prejudice
"way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice",Pride & Prejudice
and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the,Pride & Prejudice
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond,Pride & Prejudice
"anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be",Pride & Prejudice
"acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and",Pride & Prejudice
respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general,Pride & Prejudice
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views,Pride & Prejudice
"were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I",Pride & Prejudice
"can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that",Pride & Prejudice
"being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured",Pride & Prejudice
"father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy",Pride & Prejudice
"myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that",Pride & Prejudice
"the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy",Pride & Prejudice
"event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not",Pride & Prejudice
"be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and",Pride & Prejudice
I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing,Pride & Prejudice
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the,Pride & Prejudice
"violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and",Pride & Prejudice
"shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well",Pride & Prejudice
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds,Pride & Prejudice
"in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's",Pride & Prejudice
"decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,",Pride & Prejudice
"therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that",Pride & Prejudice
"no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You are too hasty, sir,"" she cried. ""You forget that I have made no",Pride & Prejudice
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for,Pride & Prejudice
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of,Pride & Prejudice
"your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to",Pride & Prejudice
"decline them.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am not now to learn,"" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the",Pride & Prejudice
"hand, ""that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the",Pride & Prejudice
"man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their",Pride & Prejudice
"favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a",Pride & Prejudice
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just,Pride & Prejudice
"said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Upon my word, sir,"" cried Elizabeth, ""your hope is a rather",Pride & Prejudice
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not,Pride & Prejudice
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so,Pride & Prejudice
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second,Pride & Prejudice
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_,Pride & Prejudice
"happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,"" said Mr. Collins",Pride & Prejudice
"very gravely--""but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all",Pride & Prejudice

"seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your",Pride & Prejudice
"modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You",Pride & Prejudice
"must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment",Pride & Prejudice
"of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by",Pride & Prejudice
"refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.",Pride & Prejudice
"In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your",Pride & Prejudice

to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect,Pride & Prejudice
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant,Pride & Prejudice

"to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open",Pride & Prejudice
"the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she",Pride & Prejudice
"entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in",Pride & Prejudice
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins,Pride & Prejudice
"received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then",Pride & Prejudice
"proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result",Pride & Prejudice
"of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the",Pride & Prejudice

"expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,",Pride & Prejudice

"civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and",Pride & Prejudice

till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost,Pride & Prejudice
"secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,",Pride & Prejudice
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.,Pride & Prejudice
"His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas",Pride & Prejudice
"perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and",Pride & Prejudice
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had,Pride & Prejudice
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,",Pride & Prejudice
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as,Pride & Prejudice
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that,Pride & Prejudice
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must,Pride & Prejudice
"be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with",Pride & Prejudice
his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must,Pride & Prejudice
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its,Pride & Prejudice
"continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure",Pride & Prejudice
"and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that",Pride & Prejudice
establishment were gained.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;,Pride & Prejudice
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present,Pride & Prejudice
"circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom",Pride & Prejudice
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were,Pride & Prejudice
"exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more",Pride & Prejudice
"interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer",Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided,Pride & Prejudice
"opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the",Pride & Prejudice
"Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife",Pride & Prejudice
"should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,",Pride & Prejudice
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes,Pride & Prejudice
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have,Pride & Prejudice
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's,Pride & Prejudice
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had,Pride & Prejudice
"gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were",Pride & Prejudice
"in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible",Pride & Prejudice
"nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must",Pride & Prejudice
be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly,Pride & Prejudice
"either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was",Pride & Prejudice
"the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,",Pride & Prejudice
"and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest",Pride & Prejudice
preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at,Pride & Prejudice
"the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all",Pride & Prejudice
the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business,Pride & Prejudice
"was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship",Pride & Prejudice
"she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,",Pride & Prejudice
and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be,Pride & Prejudice
"shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved",Pride & Prejudice
"to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,",Pride & Prejudice
"when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had",Pride & Prejudice
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very,Pride & Prejudice
"dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the",Pride & Prejudice
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct,Pride & Prejudice
"questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was",Pride & Prejudice
"at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to",Pride & Prejudice
publish his prosperous love.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the,Pride & Prejudice
"family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved",Pride & Prejudice
"for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,",Pride & Prejudice
"said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever",Pride & Prejudice
his engagements might allow him to visit them.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear madam,"" he replied, ""this invitation is particularly",Pride & Prejudice
"gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and",Pride & Prejudice
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as,Pride & Prejudice
"possible.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for",Pride & Prejudice
"so speedy a return, immediately said:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my",Pride & Prejudice
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of,Pride & Prejudice
"offending your patroness.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear sir,"" replied Mr. Collins, ""I am particularly obliged to you",Pride & Prejudice
"for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so",Pride & Prejudice
"material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her",Pride & Prejudice
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us,Pride & Prejudice
"again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,",Pride & Prejudice
"and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such",Pride & Prejudice
"affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive",Pride & Prejudice
"from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your",Pride & Prejudice
"regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though",Pride & Prejudice
"my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now",Pride & Prejudice
"take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my",Pride & Prejudice
"cousin Elizabeth.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally,Pride & Prejudice
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to,Pride & Prejudice
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her,Pride & Prejudice
"younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.",Pride & Prejudice
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was,Pride & Prejudice
"a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no",Pride & Prejudice
"means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read",Pride & Prejudice
"and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very",Pride & Prejudice
"agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this",Pride & Prejudice
"kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a",Pride & Prejudice
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her,Pride & Prejudice
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but,Pride & Prejudice
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from,Pride & Prejudice
"possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was",Pride & Prejudice
"consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and",Pride & Prejudice
she could not help crying out:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her,Pride & Prejudice
"story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a",Pride & Prejudice
"reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained",Pride & Prejudice
"her composure, and calmly replied:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible",Pride & Prejudice
"that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,",Pride & Prejudice
"because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort",Pride & Prejudice
"for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of",Pride & Prejudice
"their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her",Pride & Prejudice
all imaginable happiness.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I see what you are feeling,"" replied Charlotte. ""You must be surprised,",Pride & Prejudice
very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry,Pride & Prejudice
"you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be",Pride & Prejudice
"satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never",Pride & Prejudice
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's,Pride & Prejudice
"character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my",Pride & Prejudice
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on,Pride & Prejudice
"entering the marriage state.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth quietly answered ""Undoubtedly;"" and after an awkward pause,",Pride & Prejudice
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much,Pride & Prejudice
"longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.",Pride & Prejudice
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so,Pride & Prejudice
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers,Pride & Prejudice
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now,Pride & Prejudice
accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was,Pride & Prejudice
"not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible",Pride & Prejudice
"that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better",Pride & Prejudice
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a,Pride & Prejudice
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself,Pride & Prejudice
"and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it",Pride & Prejudice
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had,Pride & Prejudice
chosen.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 23,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what",Pride & Prejudice
"she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention",Pride & Prejudice
"it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to",Pride & Prejudice
"announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,",Pride & Prejudice
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the,Pride & Prejudice
"houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but",Pride & Prejudice
"incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,",Pride & Prejudice
"protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and",Pride & Prejudice
"often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know",Pride & Prejudice
"that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne,Pride & Prejudice
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried,Pride & Prejudice
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the,Pride & Prejudice
"truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the",Pride & Prejudice
most forbearing courtesy.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant",Pride & Prejudice
"a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by",Pride & Prejudice
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and,Pride & Prejudice
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,Pride & Prejudice
"by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she",Pride & Prejudice
"was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the",Pride & Prejudice
"happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character",Pride & Prejudice
"of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while,Pride & Prejudice
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings,Pride & Prejudice
"found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving",Pride & Prejudice
"the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins",Pride & Prejudice
"had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be",Pride & Prejudice
"happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two",Pride & Prejudice
"inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she,Pride & Prejudice
herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two,Pride & Prejudice
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could,Pride & Prejudice
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her,Pride & Prejudice
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without,Pride & Prejudice
"scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William",Pride & Prejudice
"or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she",Pride & Prejudice
could at all forgive their daughter.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such",Pride & Prejudice
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for,Pride & Prejudice
"it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had",Pride & Prejudice
"been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and",Pride & Prejudice
more foolish than his daughter!,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said,Pride & Prejudice
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;,Pride & Prejudice
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty,Pride & Prejudice
"and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a",Pride & Prejudice
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news,Pride & Prejudice
to spread at Meryton.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort,Pride & Prejudice
on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she,Pride & Prejudice
"called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,",Pride & Prejudice
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been,Pride & Prejudice
enough to drive happiness away.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them,Pride & Prejudice
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that,Pride & Prejudice
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her,Pride & Prejudice
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her,Pride & Prejudice
"sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could",Pride & Prejudice
"never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,",Pride & Prejudice
as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his,Pride & Prejudice
return.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting",Pride & Prejudice
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised,Pride & Prejudice
"letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to",Pride & Prejudice
"their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a",Pride & Prejudice
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging,Pride & Prejudice
"his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many",Pride & Prejudice
"rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection",Pride & Prejudice
"of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was",Pride & Prejudice
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready,Pride & Prejudice
"to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither",Pride & Prejudice
"he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,",Pride & Prejudice
"he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take",Pride & Prejudice
"place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable",Pride & Prejudice
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him,Pride & Prejudice
the happiest of men.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of,Pride & Prejudice
"pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to",Pride & Prejudice
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come,Pride & Prejudice
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient,Pride & Prejudice
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house,Pride & Prejudice
"while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the",Pride & Prejudice
"most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and",Pride & Prejudice
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued,Pride & Prejudice
absence.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after,Pride & Prejudice
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the,Pride & Prejudice
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to,Pride & Prejudice
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous",Pride & Prejudice
falsehood.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that,Pride & Prejudice
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as,Pride & Prejudice
"she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so",Pride & Prejudice
"dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its",Pride & Prejudice
frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,Pride & Prejudice
"and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for",Pride & Prejudice
the strength of his attachment.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more",Pride & Prejudice
"painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of",Pride & Prejudice
"concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject",Pride & Prejudice
"was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,",Pride & Prejudice
"an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her",Pride & Prejudice
"impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he",Pride & Prejudice
did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed,Pride & Prejudice
all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable,Pride & Prejudice
tranquillity.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his",Pride & Prejudice
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his,Pride & Prejudice
"first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;",Pride & Prejudice
"and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them",Pride & Prejudice
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by,Pride & Prejudice
"him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time",Pride & Prejudice
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of,Pride & Prejudice
"anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,",Pride & Prejudice
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight,Pride & Prejudice
"of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she",Pride & Prejudice
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see,Pride & Prejudice
"them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and",Pride & Prejudice
"whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that",Pride & Prejudice
"they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself",Pride & Prejudice
"and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She",Pride & Prejudice
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"" said she, ""it is very hard to think that Charlotte",Pride & Prejudice
"Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to",Pride & Prejudice
"make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for",Pride & Prejudice
"better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of",Pride & Prejudice
"making any answer, she went on as before.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was",Pride & Prejudice
"not for the entail, I should not mind it.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""What should not you mind?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I should not mind anything at all.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such",Pride & Prejudice
"insensibility.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How",Pride & Prejudice
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own,Pride & Prejudice
"daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!",Pride & Prejudice
"Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I leave it to yourself to determine,"" said Mr. Bennet.",Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 24,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first",Pride & Prejudice
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for,Pride & Prejudice
"the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had",Pride & Prejudice
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left,Pride & Prejudice
the country.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest",Pride & Prejudice
"of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the",Pride & Prejudice
"writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied",Pride & Prejudice
"the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline",Pride & Prejudice
"boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict",Pride & Prejudice
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former,Pride & Prejudice
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an,Pride & Prejudice
"inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of",Pride & Prejudice
the latter with regard to new furniture.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,",Pride & Prejudice
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern,Pride & Prejudice
"for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's",Pride & Prejudice
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no,Pride & Prejudice
"credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she",Pride & Prejudice
"had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she",Pride & Prejudice
"could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness",Pride & Prejudice
"of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave",Pride & Prejudice
"of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness",Pride & Prejudice
"to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,",Pride & Prejudice
"been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in",Pride & Prejudice
"whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as",Pride & Prejudice
"she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,",Pride & Prejudice
"on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She",Pride & Prejudice
could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really,Pride & Prejudice
"died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether",Pride & Prejudice
"he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his",Pride & Prejudice
"observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be",Pride & Prejudice
"materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained",Pride & Prejudice
"the same, her peace equally wounded.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a",Pride & Prejudice
"longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could",Pride & Prejudice
not help saying:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no",Pride & Prejudice
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But,Pride & Prejudice
"I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall",Pride & Prejudice
"all be as we were before.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said",Pride & Prejudice
nothing.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You doubt me,"" cried Jane, slightly colouring; ""indeed, you have",Pride & Prejudice
no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my,Pride & Prejudice

and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A,Pride & Prejudice

"""My dear Jane!"" exclaimed Elizabeth, ""you are too good. Your sweetness",Pride & Prejudice

the praise on her sister's warm affection.,Pride & Prejudice

"to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not",Pride & Prejudice
"be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your",Pride & Prejudice
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people,Pride & Prejudice
"whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see",Pride & Prejudice
"of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms",Pride & Prejudice
"my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the",Pride & Prejudice
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or,Pride & Prejudice
"sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the",Pride & Prejudice

saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy,Pride & Prejudice

"by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so",Pride & Prejudice
"well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger",Pride & Prejudice

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to,Pride & Prejudice
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was,Pride & Prejudice
done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They",Pride & Prejudice

"Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded",Pride & Prejudice
of her sister's ready acquiescence.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I hope,"" added Mrs. Gardiner, ""that no consideration with regard to",Pride & Prejudice
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of,Pride & Prejudice

"convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely",Pride & Prejudice
"hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that",Pride & Prejudice

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,",Pride & Prejudice
"the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its",Pride & Prejudice
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment,Pride & Prejudice
"of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family",Pride & Prejudice
"dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always",Pride & Prejudice
made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and,Pride & Prejudice
"on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's",Pride & Prejudice
"warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,",Pride & Prejudice
"from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference",Pride & Prejudice
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and,Pride & Prejudice
she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left,Pride & Prejudice
"Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such",Pride & Prejudice
an attachment.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,",Pride & Prejudice
"unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,",Pride & Prejudice
"before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very",Pride & Prejudice
"part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many",Pride & Prejudice
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since,Pride & Prejudice

intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of,Pride & Prejudice
procuring.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by",Pride & Prejudice
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject,Pride & Prejudice
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute,Pride & Prejudice
"description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of",Pride & Prejudice
"praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both",Pride & Prejudice
him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's,Pride & Prejudice
"treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's",Pride & Prejudice

of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does,Pride & Prejudice

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted,Pride & Prejudice
"by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,",Pride & Prejudice
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was,Pride & Prejudice
"now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from,Pride & Prejudice
"the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on",Pride & Prejudice
the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their,Pride & Prejudice
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that,Pride & Prejudice
it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never,Pride & Prejudice
"address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,",Pride & Prejudice
"and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the",Pride & Prejudice
"sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters",Pride & Prejudice
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be,Pride & Prejudice
"curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would",Pride & Prejudice
"like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to",Pride & Prejudice
"be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte",Pride & Prejudice
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She,Pride & Prejudice
"wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing",Pride & Prejudice
"which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and",Pride & Prejudice
"roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most",Pride & Prejudice
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and,Pride & Prejudice
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait,Pride & Prejudice
for her own visit there to know the rest.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their,Pride & Prejudice
"safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it",Pride & Prejudice
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience,Pride & Prejudice
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or,Pride & Prejudice
"hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that",Pride & Prejudice
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been,Pride & Prejudice
lost.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My aunt,"" she continued, ""is going to-morrow into that part of the",Pride & Prejudice
"town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.",Pride & Prejudice
"""I did not think Caroline in spirits,"" were her words, ""but she was very",Pride & Prejudice
"glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming",Pride & Prejudice
"to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached",Pride & Prejudice
"her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much",Pride & Prejudice
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that,Pride & Prejudice
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was,Pride & Prejudice
"not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall",Pride & Prejudice
"see them soon here.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that,Pride & Prejudice
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to",Pride & Prejudice
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be,Pride & Prejudice
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning,Pride & Prejudice
"for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the",Pride & Prejudice
"visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,",Pride & Prejudice
the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no,Pride & Prejudice
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will,Pride & Prejudice
prove what she felt.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her",Pride & Prejudice
"better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been",Pride & Prejudice
"entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,",Pride & Prejudice
"though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I",Pride & Prejudice
"still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was",Pride & Prejudice
as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for,Pride & Prejudice
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to,Pride & Prejudice
"happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not",Pride & Prejudice
"return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I",Pride & Prejudice
"receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that",Pride & Prejudice
"she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not",Pride & Prejudice
"calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was",Pride & Prejudice
"in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was",Pride & Prejudice
"perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,",Pride & Prejudice
though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out,Pride & Prejudice
as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on,Pride & Prejudice
"her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting",Pride & Prejudice
"wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the",Pride & Prejudice
cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know,Pride & Prejudice
"this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily",Pride & Prejudice
account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to,Pride & Prejudice
"his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and",Pride & Prejudice
"amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,",Pride & Prejudice
"because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.",Pride & Prejudice
"He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said",Pride & Prejudice
"herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she",Pride & Prejudice
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I,Pride & Prejudice
"cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should",Pride & Prejudice
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity,Pride & Prejudice
"in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,",Pride & Prejudice
"and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the",Pride & Prejudice
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very,Pride & Prejudice
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield,Pride & Prejudice
"again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better",Pride & Prejudice
not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts,Pride & Prejudice
"from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and",Pride & Prejudice
"Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she,Pride & Prejudice
"considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.",Pride & Prejudice
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not,Pride & Prejudice
even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on,Pride & Prejudice
"every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible",Pride & Prejudice
"advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly",Pride & Prejudice
regret what he had thrown away.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise,Pride & Prejudice
"concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth",Pride & Prejudice
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to,Pride & Prejudice
"herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,",Pride & Prejudice
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to,Pride & Prejudice
"see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.",Pride & Prejudice
"Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied",Pride & Prejudice
"with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune",Pride & Prejudice
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most,Pride & Prejudice
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself,Pride & Prejudice
"agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than",Pride & Prejudice
"in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.",Pride & Prejudice
"Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to",Pride & Prejudice
"suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was",Pride & Prejudice
"ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very",Pride & Prejudice
sincerely wish him happy.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the,Pride & Prejudice
"circumstances, she thus went on: ""I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that",Pride & Prejudice
I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure,Pride & Prejudice
"and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and",Pride & Prejudice
wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial,Pride & Prejudice
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find,Pride & Prejudice
"out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to",Pride & Prejudice
think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My,Pride & Prejudice
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more,Pride & Prejudice
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love,Pride & Prejudice
"with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.",Pride & Prejudice
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take,Pride & Prejudice
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise",Pride & Prejudice
"diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and",Pride & Prejudice
"sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of,Pride & Prejudice
"going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan",Pride & Prejudice
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure,Pride & Prejudice
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing,Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There",Pride & Prejudice
"was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such",Pride & Prejudice
"uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change",Pride & Prejudice
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her,Pride & Prejudice
"a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have",Pride & Prejudice
"been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,",Pride & Prejudice
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was,Pride & Prejudice
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement,Pride & Prejudice
"of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became",Pride & Prejudice
perfect as plan could be.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,",Pride & Prejudice
"and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he",Pride & Prejudice
"told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on,Pride & Prejudice
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the",Pride & Prejudice
"first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner",Pride & Prejudice
"of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of",Pride & Prejudice
"what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their",Pride & Prejudice
"opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there",Pride & Prejudice
"was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to",Pride & Prejudice
"him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,",Pride & Prejudice
"whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable",Pride & Prejudice
and pleasing.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her,Pride & Prejudice
"think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a",Pride & Prejudice
"good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say",Pride & Prejudice
"that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much",Pride & Prejudice
"delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but",Pride & Prejudice
she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of,Pride & Prejudice
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were,Pride & Prejudice
"worn out, like his information.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early",Pride & Prejudice
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's,Pride & Prejudice
"door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when",Pride & Prejudice
"they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,",Pride & Prejudice
"looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and",Pride & Prejudice
"lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,",Pride & Prejudice
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to,Pride & Prejudice
"wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen",Pride & Prejudice
"her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and",Pride & Prejudice
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and,Pride & Prejudice
"shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her,Pride & Prejudice
"sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to",Pride & Prejudice
"her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her",Pride & Prejudice
"spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,",Pride & Prejudice
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the,Pride & Prejudice
"particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and",Pride & Prejudice
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and,Pride & Prejudice
"herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the",Pride & Prejudice
acquaintance.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and",Pride & Prejudice
complimented her on bearing it so well.,Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 28,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had,Pride & Prejudice
"seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,",Pride & Prejudice
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in",Pride & Prejudice
"search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.",Pride & Prejudice
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth,Pride & Prejudice
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the,Pride & Prejudice
"road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,",Pride & Prejudice
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte,Pride & Prejudice
"appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which",Pride & Prejudice
"led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of",Pride & Prejudice
"the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing",Pride & Prejudice
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the,Pride & Prejudice
"liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with",Pride & Prejudice
coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw,Pride & Prejudice
instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;,Pride & Prejudice
"his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some",Pride & Prejudice
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her,Pride & Prejudice
"family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the",Pride & Prejudice
"neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they",Pride & Prejudice
"were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious",Pride & Prejudice
"formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's",Pride & Prejudice
offers of refreshment.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help,Pride & Prejudice
"in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its",Pride & Prejudice
"aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,",Pride & Prejudice
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But,Pride & Prejudice
"though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to",Pride & Prejudice
"gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at",Pride & Prejudice
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.,Pride & Prejudice
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be,Pride & Prejudice
"ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her",Pride & Prejudice
eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but,Pride & Prejudice
in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to,Pride & Prejudice
"admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to",Pride & Prejudice
"the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had",Pride & Prejudice
"happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the",Pride & Prejudice
"garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of",Pride & Prejudice
which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most,Pride & Prejudice
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance,Pride & Prejudice
"with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and",Pride & Prejudice
"owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way",Pride & Prejudice
"through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an",Pride & Prejudice
"interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out",Pride & Prejudice
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the,Pride & Prejudice
"fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in",Pride & Prejudice
"the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which",Pride & Prejudice
"the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the",Pride & Prejudice
"prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered",Pride & Prejudice
the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome,Pride & Prejudice
"modern building, well situated on rising ground.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;",Pride & Prejudice
"but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white",Pride & Prejudice
"frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte",Pride & Prejudice
"took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,",Pride & Prejudice
"probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's",Pride & Prejudice
"help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything",Pride & Prejudice
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be,Pride & Prejudice
"forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by",Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often",Pride & Prejudice
forgotten.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It,Pride & Prejudice
"was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining",Pride & Prejudice
"in, observed:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine",Pride & Prejudice

doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice,Pride & Prejudice
when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she,Pride & Prejudice
will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she,Pride & Prejudice
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is,Pride & Prejudice
"charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed",Pride & Prejudice
to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I,Pride & Prejudice
"_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"" added",Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte, ""and a most attentive neighbour.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of",Pride & Prejudice
"woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,",Pride & Prejudice
"and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon",Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,",Pride & Prejudice
"and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it",Pride & Prejudice
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit,Pride & Prejudice
"would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious",Pride & Prejudice
"interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with",Pride & Prejudice
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready",Pride & Prejudice
"for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in",Pride & Prejudice
"confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running",Pride & Prejudice
"up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened",Pride & Prejudice
"the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with",Pride & Prejudice
"agitation, cried out--",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for",Pride & Prejudice
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make,Pride & Prejudice
"haste, and come down this moment.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,",Pride & Prejudice
"and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in",Pride & Prejudice
quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the,Pride & Prejudice
garden gate.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And is this all?"" cried Elizabeth. ""I expected at least that the pigs",Pride & Prejudice
"were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her",Pride & Prejudice
"daughter.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""La! my dear,"" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, ""it is not",Pride & Prejudice
"Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;",Pride & Prejudice
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little,Pride & Prejudice
"creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?""",Pride & Prejudice

"""She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.",Pride & Prejudice
"Why does she not come in?""",Pride & Prejudice

"""Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""I like her appearance,"" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. ""She",Pride & Prejudice
"looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will",Pride & Prejudice
"make him a very proper wife.""",Pride & Prejudice

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation,Pride & Prejudice
"with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was",Pride & Prejudice
"stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness",Pride & Prejudice
"before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that",Pride & Prejudice
way.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and",Pride & Prejudice
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two,Pride & Prejudice
"girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which",Pride & Prejudice

to dine at Rosings the next day.,Pride & Prejudice

The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering,Pride & Prejudice
"visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his",Pride & Prejudice
"wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity",Pride & Prejudice
"of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady",Pride & Prejudice
"Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I confess,"" said he, ""that I should not have been at all surprised by",Pride & Prejudice
her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at,Pride & Prejudice
"Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it",Pride & Prejudice
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who,Pride & Prejudice
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there,Pride & Prejudice
"(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately",Pride & Prejudice
"after your arrival!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am the less surprised at what has happened,"" replied Sir William,",Pride & Prejudice
"""from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which",Pride & Prejudice
"my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such",Pride & Prejudice
"instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their,Pride & Prejudice
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what,Pride & Prejudice
"they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and",Pride & Prejudice
"so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.",Pride & Prejudice

"When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady",Pride & Prejudice
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which,Pride & Prejudice
becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on,Pride & Prejudice
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion,Pride & Prejudice
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you,Pride & Prejudice

"preserved.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different",Pride & Prejudice
"doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much",Pride & Prejudice
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of,Pride & Prejudice
"her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas",Pride & Prejudice
"who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her",Pride & Prejudice
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done,Pride & Prejudice
to his presentation at St. James's.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a",Pride & Prejudice
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such",Pride & Prejudice
"raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but",Pride & Prejudice
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the,Pride & Prejudice
"house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally",Pride & Prejudice
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every",Pride & Prejudice
"moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady,Pride & Prejudice

"miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought",Pride & Prejudice
she could witness without trepidation.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a",Pride & Prejudice
"rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they",Pride & Prejudice
"followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady",Pride & Prejudice
"Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,",Pride & Prejudice
"with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had",Pride & Prejudice
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should,Pride & Prejudice
"be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those",Pride & Prejudice
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely",Pride & Prejudice
"awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage",Pride & Prejudice
"enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;",Pride & Prejudice
"and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge",Pride & Prejudice
"of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself",Pride & Prejudice
"quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her",Pride & Prejudice
"composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked",Pride & Prejudice
"features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not",Pride & Prejudice
"conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her",Pride & Prejudice
visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by,Pride & Prejudice
"silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,",Pride & Prejudice
"as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she",Pride & Prejudice
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.,Pride & Prejudice

"When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment",Pride & Prejudice
"she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the",Pride & Prejudice
"daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her",Pride & Prejudice
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any,Pride & Prejudice
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her,Pride & Prejudice
"features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very",Pride & Prejudice
"little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance",Pride & Prejudice
"there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening",Pride & Prejudice
"to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before",Pride & Prejudice
her eyes.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to",Pride & Prejudice
"admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,",Pride & Prejudice
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth,Pride & Prejudice
looking at in the summer.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and",Pride & Prejudice
"all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had",Pride & Prejudice
"likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her",Pride & Prejudice
"ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish",Pride & Prejudice
"nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted",Pride & Prejudice
"alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir",Pride & Prejudice
"William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law",Pride & Prejudice
"said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.",Pride & Prejudice
"But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and",Pride & Prejudice
"gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved",Pride & Prejudice
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth,Pride & Prejudice
"was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated",Pride & Prejudice
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in,Pride & Prejudice
"listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all",Pride & Prejudice
dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little,Pride & Prejudice
"Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing",Pride & Prejudice
"she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the",Pride & Prejudice
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to",Pride & Prejudice
"be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any",Pride & Prejudice
"intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every",Pride & Prejudice
"subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to",Pride & Prejudice
have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic,Pride & Prejudice
"concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as",Pride & Prejudice
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be,Pride & Prejudice
"regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the",Pride & Prejudice
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was,Pride & Prejudice
"beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an",Pride & Prejudice
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse,Pride & Prejudice
"with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew",Pride & Prejudice
"the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,",Pride & Prejudice
"pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters",Pride & Prejudice
"she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of",Pride & Prejudice
"them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they",Pride & Prejudice
"had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been",Pride & Prejudice
her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of,Pride & Prejudice
her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then,Pride & Prejudice
"observed,",Pride & Prejudice

"When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables",Pride & Prejudice
"were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat",Pride & Prejudice
"down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the",Pride & Prejudice
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her,Pride & Prejudice
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was,Pride & Prejudice
"uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson",Pride & Prejudice
"expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or",Pride & Prejudice
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the,Pride & Prejudice
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes,Pride & Prejudice
"of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins",Pride & Prejudice
"was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her",Pride & Prejudice
"for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.",Pride & Prejudice
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes,Pride & Prejudice
and noble names.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,",Pride & Prejudice
"the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,",Pride & Prejudice
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered,Pride & Prejudice
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were,Pride & Prejudice
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by,Pride & Prejudice
the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.,Pride & Prejudice
Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon,Pride & Prejudice
"as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin",Pride & Prejudice
"to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for",Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her",Pride & Prejudice
"commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise",Pride & Prejudice
into his own hands.,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long",Pride & Prejudice
"enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,",Pride & Prejudice
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not,Pride & Prejudice
"often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his",Pride & Prejudice
"morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but",Pride & Prejudice
"when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,",Pride & Prejudice
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her,Pride & Prejudice
"cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast",Pride & Prejudice
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in,Pride & Prejudice
"reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,",Pride & Prejudice
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer,Pride & Prejudice
"the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a",Pride & Prejudice
more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent,Pride & Prejudice
"reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been",Pride & Prejudice
"much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and",Pride & Prejudice
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and",Pride & Prejudice
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went,Pride & Prejudice
"along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,",Pride & Prejudice
"which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened",Pride & Prejudice
"almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and",Pride & Prejudice
"had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever",Pride & Prejudice
prevailed upon to get out.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and",Pride & Prejudice
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;,Pride & Prejudice
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings,Pride & Prejudice
"to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many",Pride & Prejudice
"hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,",Pride & Prejudice
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during,Pride & Prejudice
"these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,",Pride & Prejudice
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement,Pride & Prejudice
of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she,Pride & Prejudice
"accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding",Pride & Prejudice
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in",Pride & Prejudice
"commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate",Pride & Prejudice
"in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her",Pride & Prejudice
by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to,Pride & Prejudice
"be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the",Pride & Prejudice
"village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold",Pride & Prejudice
them into harmony and plenty.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;,Pride & Prejudice
"and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one",Pride & Prejudice
"card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart",Pride & Prejudice
"of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living",Pride & Prejudice
"in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,",Pride & Prejudice
"however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time",Pride & Prejudice
comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with,Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had",Pride & Prejudice
"often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she",Pride & Prejudice
"frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was",Pride & Prejudice
"along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was",Pride & Prejudice
"a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and",Pride & Prejudice
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.",Pride & Prejudice
"Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an",Pride & Prejudice
"addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be",Pride & Prejudice
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was,Pride & Prejudice
"expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not",Pride & Prejudice
"many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would",Pride & Prejudice
"furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and",Pride & Prejudice
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him,Pride & Prejudice
"were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently",Pride & Prejudice
"destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest",Pride & Prejudice
"satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and",Pride & Prejudice
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by,Pride & Prejudice
Miss Lucas and herself.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking,Pride & Prejudice
"the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,",Pride & Prejudice
"in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his",Pride & Prejudice
"bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great",Pride & Prejudice
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his,Pride & Prejudice
"respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of",Pride & Prejudice
"his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen",Pride & Prejudice
"them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running",Pride & Prejudice
"into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would",Pride & Prejudice
"never have come so soon to wait upon me.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,",Pride & Prejudice
"before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly",Pride & Prejudice
"afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,",Pride & Prejudice
"who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and",Pride & Prejudice
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been,Pride & Prejudice
"used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual",Pride & Prejudice
"reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her",Pride & Prejudice
"friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely",Pride & Prejudice
curtseyed to him without saying a word.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the,Pride & Prejudice
"readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but",Pride & Prejudice
"his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and",Pride & Prejudice
"garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.",Pride & Prejudice
"At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual,Pride & Prejudice
"way, and after a moment's pause, added:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never",Pride & Prejudice
"happened to see her there?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see,Pride & Prejudice
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between,Pride & Prejudice
"the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he",Pride & Prejudice
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The,Pride & Prejudice
"subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went",Pride & Prejudice
away.,Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 31,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,",Pride & Prejudice
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures,Pride & Prejudice
"of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they",Pride & Prejudice
received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the,Pride & Prejudice
"house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,",Pride & Prejudice
"almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by",Pride & Prejudice
"such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to",Pride & Prejudice
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little,Pride & Prejudice
of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the,Pride & Prejudice
"Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen",Pride & Prejudice
only at church.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined",Pride & Prejudice
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received,Pride & Prejudice
"them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so",Pride & Prejudice
"acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,",Pride & Prejudice
"almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,",Pride & Prejudice
much more than to any other person in the room.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a,Pride & Prejudice
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had,Pride & Prejudice
"moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and",Pride & Prejudice
"talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying",Pride & Prejudice
"at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so",Pride & Prejudice
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much,Pride & Prejudice
"spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,",Pride & Prejudice
as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned,Pride & Prejudice
"towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a",Pride & Prejudice
"while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not",Pride & Prejudice
scruple to call out:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking",Pride & Prejudice
"of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.""",Pride & Prejudice

"I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health",Pride & Prejudice
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed,Pride & Prejudice
"delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?""",Pride & Prejudice

"talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away",Pride & Prejudice

"""It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond",Pride & Prejudice
"the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.""",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice

Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""Are you pleased with Kent?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side",Pride & Prejudice
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte,Pride & Prejudice
"and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised",Pride & Prejudice
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding,Pride & Prejudice
"on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying",Pride & Prejudice
"much to anybody, went away.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice

"gone. ""My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never",Pride & Prejudice
"have called us in this familiar way.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,",Pride & Prejudice
"even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various",Pride & Prejudice
"conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from",Pride & Prejudice
"the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable",Pride & Prejudice
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there,Pride & Prejudice
"was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot",Pride & Prejudice
"always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the",Pride & Prejudice
"pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the",Pride & Prejudice
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither,Pride & Prejudice
"almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes",Pride & Prejudice
"separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their",Pride & Prejudice
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he,Pride & Prejudice
"had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended",Pride & Prejudice
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in,Pride & Prejudice
"being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her",Pride & Prejudice
"former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw",Pride & Prejudice
"there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,",Pride & Prejudice
she believed he might have the best informed mind.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult",Pride & Prejudice
"to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there",Pride & Prejudice
"ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,",Pride & Prejudice
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice,Pride & Prejudice
"to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really",Pride & Prejudice
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel,Pride & Prejudice
"Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was",Pride & Prejudice
"generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told",Pride & Prejudice
her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect,Pride & Prejudice
"of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself",Pride & Prejudice
seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at,Pride & Prejudice
"Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He",Pride & Prejudice
"certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that",Pride & Prejudice
"look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often",Pride & Prejudice
"doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it",Pride & Prejudice
seemed nothing but absence of mind.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his,Pride & Prejudice
"being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of",Pride & Prejudice
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her,Pride & Prejudice
"opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would",Pride & Prejudice
"vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying",Pride & Prejudice
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,",Pride & Prejudice
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the,Pride & Prejudice
"mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to",Pride & Prejudice
"prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that",Pride & Prejudice
"it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,",Pride & Prejudice
"therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like",Pride & Prejudice
"wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was",Pride & Prejudice
"not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,",Pride & Prejudice
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He,Pride & Prejudice
"never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking",Pride & Prejudice
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third,Pride & Prejudice
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about,Pride & Prejudice
"her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her",Pride & Prejudice
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of,Pride & Prejudice
"Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to",Pride & Prejudice
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying,Pride & Prejudice
_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel,Pride & Prejudice
"Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must",Pride & Prejudice
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed,Pride & Prejudice
"her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the",Pride & Prejudice
pales opposite the Parsonage.,Pride & Prejudice

together.,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least",Pride & Prejudice

"""He likes to have his own way very well,"" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.",Pride & Prejudice
"""But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it",Pride & Prejudice

"Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in",Pride & Prejudice

"him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that",Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""What is it you mean?""",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with",Pride & Prejudice

This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture,Pride & Prejudice
"of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and",Pride & Prejudice
"therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent",Pride & Prejudice
"matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,",Pride & Prejudice
"as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption",Pride & Prejudice
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other,Pride & Prejudice
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There,Pride & Prejudice
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have,Pride & Prejudice
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures,Pride & Prejudice
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had,Pride & Prejudice
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement,Pride & Prejudice
"of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was",Pride & Prejudice

"peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and",Pride & Prejudice
"respectability which he will probably never reach."" When she thought of",Pride & Prejudice
"her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow",Pride & Prejudice
"that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose",Pride & Prejudice
"pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of",Pride & Prejudice

"by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.",Pride & Prejudice

"When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself",Pride & Prejudice
"as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the",Pride & Prejudice
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her,Pride & Prejudice

"revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.",Pride & Prejudice
"But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that",Pride & Prejudice
"cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,",Pride & Prejudice
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly,Pride & Prejudice
"disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth",Pride & Prejudice
"noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an",Pride & Prejudice
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's,Pride & Prejudice
"shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her",Pride & Prejudice
a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation,Pride & Prejudice
to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the,Pride & Prejudice
"next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should",Pride & Prejudice
"herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of",Pride & Prejudice
"her spirits, by all that affection could do.",Pride & Prejudice

She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that,Pride & Prejudice

"She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and",Pride & Prejudice
"then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but",Pride & Prejudice
"said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her",Pride & Prejudice
"in an agitated manner, and thus began:",Pride & Prejudice

immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides,Pride & Prejudice

"of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but",Pride & Prejudice
his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could,Pride & Prejudice
"only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how",Pride & Prejudice
"to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for",Pride & Prejudice
"half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,",Pride & Prejudice
was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of,Pride & Prejudice
marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for,Pride & Prejudice
so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of,Pride & Prejudice
all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying,Pride & Prejudice
"her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his",Pride & Prejudice
own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired,Pride & Prejudice
"unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable",Pride & Prejudice
pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to,Pride & Prejudice
"Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could",Pride & Prejudice
"not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon",Pride & Prejudice
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for,Pride & Prejudice
a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the,Pride & Prejudice
sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations,Pride & Prejudice
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the,Pride & Prejudice
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything,Pride & Prejudice
"else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after",Pride & Prejudice
"breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding",Pride & Prejudice
"directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's",Pride & Prejudice
"sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,",Pride & Prejudice
"she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The",Pride & Prejudice
"park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one",Pride & Prejudice
of the gates into the ground.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was",Pride & Prejudice
"tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and",Pride & Prejudice
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had,Pride & Prejudice
"made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the",Pride & Prejudice
"verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,",Pride & Prejudice
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which,Pride & Prejudice
"edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now",Pride & Prejudice
"near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced",Pride & Prejudice
"her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though",Pride & Prejudice
"in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the",Pride & Prejudice
"gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,",Pride & Prejudice
"which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,",Pride & Prejudice
"""I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.",Pride & Prejudice
"Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"" And then, with a",Pride & Prejudice
"slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,",Pride & Prejudice
"perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written",Pride & Prejudice
"quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise",Pride & Prejudice
"full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated",Pride & Prejudice
"from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension",Pride & Prejudice
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those,Pride & Prejudice
offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any,Pride & Prejudice
"intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes",Pride & Prejudice
"which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the",Pride & Prejudice
"effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,",Pride & Prejudice
"should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written",Pride & Prejudice
"and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand",Pride & Prejudice
"your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I",Pride & Prejudice
demand it of your justice.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal",Pride & Prejudice
"magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,",Pride & Prejudice
"that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley",Pride & Prejudice
"from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various",Pride & Prejudice
"claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate",Pride & Prejudice
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and,Pride & Prejudice
"wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged",Pride & Prejudice
"favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other",Pride & Prejudice
"dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect",Pride & Prejudice
"its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young",Pride & Prejudice
"persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could",Pride & Prejudice
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last,Pride & Prejudice
"night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope",Pride & Prejudice
"to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions",Pride & Prejudice
"and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which",Pride & Prejudice
"is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which",Pride & Prejudice
"may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity",Pride & Prejudice
"must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with",Pride & Prejudice
"others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young",Pride & Prejudice
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance,Pride & Prejudice
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious,Pride & Prejudice
"attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I",Pride & Prejudice
"had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir",Pride & Prejudice
"William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to",Pride & Prejudice
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.,Pride & Prejudice
"He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could",Pride & Prejudice
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour,Pride & Prejudice
attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss,Pride & Prejudice
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also,Pride & Prejudice
"watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,",Pride & Prejudice
"but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced",Pride & Prejudice
"from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions",Pride & Prejudice
"with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of",Pride & Prejudice
"sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been",Pride & Prejudice
in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter,Pride & Prejudice
"probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict",Pride & Prejudice
"pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not",Pride & Prejudice
"scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and",Pride & Prejudice
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction,Pride & Prejudice
"that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be",Pride & Prejudice
easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is,Pride & Prejudice
certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions,Pride & Prejudice
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe,Pride & Prejudice
her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial,Pride & Prejudice
"conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the",Pride & Prejudice
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have,Pride & Prejudice
"the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of",Pride & Prejudice
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But,Pride & Prejudice
"there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still",Pride & Prejudice
"existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had",Pride & Prejudice
"myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before",Pride & Prejudice
"me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your",Pride & Prejudice
"mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that",Pride & Prejudice
"total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by",Pride & Prejudice
"herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your",Pride & Prejudice
father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern,Pride & Prejudice
"for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this",Pride & Prejudice
"representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to",Pride & Prejudice
"have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,",Pride & Prejudice
"is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than",Pride & Prejudice
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say,Pride & Prejudice
"farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties",Pride & Prejudice
"was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led",Pride & Prejudice
"me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy",Pride & Prejudice
"connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as",Pride & Prejudice
"you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness",Pride & Prejudice
had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was,Pride & Prejudice
"soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in",Pride & Prejudice
"detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in",Pride & Prejudice
London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office,Pride & Prejudice
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I,Pride & Prejudice
"described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance",Pride & Prejudice
"might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose",Pride & Prejudice
"that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been",Pride & Prejudice
"seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your",Pride & Prejudice
sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his,Pride & Prejudice
"affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great",Pride & Prejudice
"natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his",Pride & Prejudice
"own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was",Pride & Prejudice
no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into,Pride & Prejudice
"Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the",Pride & Prejudice
work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There,Pride & Prejudice
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not,Pride & Prejudice
reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the,Pride & Prejudice
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in,Pride & Prejudice
"town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her",Pride & Prejudice
brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without,Pride & Prejudice
ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me,Pride & Prejudice
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this,Pride & Prejudice
"concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it",Pride & Prejudice
"was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no",Pride & Prejudice
"other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it",Pride & Prejudice
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to,Pride & Prejudice
"you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn",Pride & Prejudice
them.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his",Pride & Prejudice
connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I,Pride & Prejudice
"am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more",Pride & Prejudice
than one witness of undoubted veracity.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many",Pride & Prejudice
"years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good",Pride & Prejudice
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to,Pride & Prejudice
"be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his",Pride & Prejudice
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at,Pride & Prejudice
"school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his",Pride & Prejudice
"own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have",Pride & Prejudice
been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only,Pride & Prejudice
"fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he",Pride & Prejudice
"had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be",Pride & Prejudice
"his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is",Pride & Prejudice
"many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different",Pride & Prejudice
"manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was",Pride & Prejudice
"careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape",Pride & Prejudice
"the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,",Pride & Prejudice
"and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree,Pride & Prejudice
you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham,Pride & Prejudice
"has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from",Pride & Prejudice
unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly",Pride & Prejudice
"recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner",Pride & Prejudice
"that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a",Pride & Prejudice
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There,Pride & Prejudice
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long,Pride & Prejudice
"survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham",Pride & Prejudice
"wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,",Pride & Prejudice
he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more,Pride & Prejudice
"immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he",Pride & Prejudice
"could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying",Pride & Prejudice
"law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would",Pride & Prejudice
"be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed",Pride & Prejudice
"him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to",Pride & Prejudice
his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the,Pride & Prejudice
business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance,Pride & Prejudice
"in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to",Pride & Prejudice
"receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection",Pride & Prejudice
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him,Pride & Prejudice
"to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly",Pride & Prejudice
"lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free",Pride & Prejudice
"from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.",Pride & Prejudice
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the,Pride & Prejudice
"incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to",Pride & Prejudice
"me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured",Pride & Prejudice
"me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He",Pride & Prejudice
"had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely",Pride & Prejudice
"resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in",Pride & Prejudice
"question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was",Pride & Prejudice
"well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not",Pride & Prejudice
have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame,Pride & Prejudice
"me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every",Pride & Prejudice
repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of,Pride & Prejudice
his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me,Pride & Prejudice
to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every,Pride & Prejudice
appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But,Pride & Prejudice
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,",Pride & Prejudice
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold,Pride & Prejudice
"to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your",Pride & Prejudice
"secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to",Pride & Prejudice
"the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.",Pride & Prejudice
"About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed",Pride & Prejudice
for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided,Pride & Prejudice
"over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by",Pride & Prejudice
design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him,Pride & Prejudice
"and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and",Pride & Prejudice
"by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,",Pride & Prejudice
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to,Pride & Prejudice
"her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and",Pride & Prejudice
"to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her",Pride & Prejudice
"excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed",Pride & Prejudice
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two,Pride & Prejudice
"before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the",Pride & Prejudice
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as,Pride & Prejudice
"a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and",Pride & Prejudice
how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented,Pride & Prejudice
"any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place",Pride & Prejudice
"immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which",Pride & Prejudice
is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of,Pride & Prejudice
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have,Pride & Prejudice
been complete indeed.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have",Pride & Prejudice
been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as,Pride & Prejudice
"false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.",Pride & Prejudice

had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered,Pride & Prejudice
"at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,",Pride & Prejudice
"detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in",Pride & Prejudice
your inclination.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but",Pride & Prejudice

"particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our",Pride & Prejudice
"near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of",Pride & Prejudice
"the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted",Pride & Prejudice
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_,Pride & Prejudice
"should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by",Pride & Prejudice
the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be,Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 36,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to",Pride & Prejudice
"contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of",Pride & Prejudice
"its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly",Pride & Prejudice
"she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.",Pride & Prejudice
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did,Pride & Prejudice
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;,Pride & Prejudice
"and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation",Pride & Prejudice
"to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong",Pride & Prejudice
"prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what",Pride & Prejudice
had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly,Pride & Prejudice
"left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the",Pride & Prejudice
"next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of",Pride & Prejudice
the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she,Pride & Prejudice
"instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst",Pride & Prejudice
"objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing",Pride & Prejudice
him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied,Pride & Prejudice
"her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and",Pride & Prejudice
insolence.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when,Pride & Prejudice
"she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,",Pride & Prejudice
"if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which",Pride & Prejudice
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her,Pride & Prejudice
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.,Pride & Prejudice
"Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished",Pride & Prejudice
"to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, ""This must be false!",Pride & Prejudice
"This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!""--and when she had",Pride & Prejudice
"gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the",Pride & Prejudice
"last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not",Pride & Prejudice
"regard it, that she would never look in it again.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on",Pride & Prejudice
"nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter",Pride & Prejudice
"was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she",Pride & Prejudice
"again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and",Pride & Prejudice
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.,Pride & Prejudice
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what,Pride & Prejudice
"he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though",Pride & Prejudice
"she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own",Pride & Prejudice
words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the,Pride & Prejudice
"will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living",Pride & Prejudice
"was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was",Pride & Prejudice
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the,Pride & Prejudice
"other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did",Pride & Prejudice
"not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the",Pride & Prejudice
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions,Pride & Prejudice
"to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three",Pride & Prejudice
"thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down",Pride & Prejudice
"the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be",Pride & Prejudice
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with,Pride & Prejudice
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read,Pride & Prejudice
"on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had",Pride & Prejudice
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to,Pride & Prejudice
"render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a",Pride & Prejudice
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could",Pride & Prejudice
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his,Pride & Prejudice
"entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the",Pride & Prejudice
"persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,",Pride & Prejudice
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,Pride & Prejudice
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As,Pride & Prejudice
"to his real character, had information been in her power, she had",Pride & Prejudice
"never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had",Pride & Prejudice
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried,Pride & Prejudice
"to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of",Pride & Prejudice
"integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those",Pride & Prejudice
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy,Pride & Prejudice
had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But,Pride & Prejudice
no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before,Pride & Prejudice
"her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more",Pride & Prejudice
"substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and",Pride & Prejudice
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After,Pride & Prejudice
"pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to",Pride & Prejudice
"read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel",Pride & Prejudice
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was,Pride & Prejudice
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam,Pride & Prejudice
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his,Pride & Prejudice
"near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no",Pride & Prejudice
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to,Pride & Prejudice
"him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and",Pride & Prejudice
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never,Pride & Prejudice
"have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his",Pride & Prejudice
cousin's corroboration.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation,Pride & Prejudice
"between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.",Pride & Prejudice
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_,Pride & Prejudice
"struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and",Pride & Prejudice
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting,Pride & Prejudice
"himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions",Pride & Prejudice
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear,Pride & Prejudice
"of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that",Pride & Prejudice
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball,Pride & Prejudice
"the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield",Pride & Prejudice
"family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but",Pride & Prejudice
herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;,Pride & Prejudice
"that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's",Pride & Prejudice
"character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would",Pride & Prejudice
always prevent his exposing the son.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!,Pride & Prejudice
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and,Pride & Prejudice
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer,Pride & Prejudice
"the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.",Pride & Prejudice
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had,Pride & Prejudice
"either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying",Pride & Prejudice
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most,Pride & Prejudice
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter,Pride & Prejudice
"and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not",Pride & Prejudice
"but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago",Pride & Prejudice
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as,Pride & Prejudice
"were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their",Pride & Prejudice
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much,Pride & Prejudice
"together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything",Pride & Prejudice
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him,Pride & Prejudice
of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was,Pride & Prejudice
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a,Pride & Prejudice
"brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his",Pride & Prejudice
sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his,Pride & Prejudice
"actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of",Pride & Prejudice
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and,Pride & Prejudice
"that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man",Pride & Prejudice
"as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham,Pride & Prejudice
"could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,",Pride & Prejudice
absurd.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""How despicably I have acted!"" she cried; ""I, who have prided myself",Pride & Prejudice
"on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have",Pride & Prejudice
"often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified",Pride & Prejudice
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this,Pride & Prejudice
"discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could",Pride & Prejudice
"not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my",Pride & Prejudice
"folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect",Pride & Prejudice
"of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted",Pride & Prejudice
"prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were",Pride & Prejudice
"concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line",Pride & Prejudice
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation,Pride & Prejudice
"_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely",Pride & Prejudice
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that,Pride & Prejudice
"credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to",Pride & Prejudice
give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her,Pride & Prejudice
sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's,Pride & Prejudice
opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his,Pride & Prejudice
"description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were",Pride & Prejudice
"little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air",Pride & Prejudice
and manner not often united with great sensibility.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were,Pride & Prejudice
"mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense",Pride & Prejudice
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly,Pride & Prejudice
"for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as",Pride & Prejudice
"having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first",Pride & Prejudice
"disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind",Pride & Prejudice
than on hers.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,",Pride & Prejudice
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been,Pride & Prejudice
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered,Pride & Prejudice
that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest,Pride & Prejudice
"relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt",Pride & Prejudice
"by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she",Pride & Prejudice
had ever known before.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every",Pride & Prejudice
"variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,",Pride & Prejudice
"and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and",Pride & Prejudice
"so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made",Pride & Prejudice
her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish,Pride & Prejudice
"of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such",Pride & Prejudice
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each,Pride & Prejudice
"called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take",Pride & Prejudice
leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least,Pride & Prejudice
"an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her",Pride & Prejudice
till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern,Pride & Prejudice
in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no,Pride & Prejudice
longer an object; she could think only of her letter.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 37,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having",Pride & Prejudice
"been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was",Pride & Prejudice
"able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very",Pride & Prejudice
"good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the",Pride & Prejudice
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then,Pride & Prejudice
"hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return",Pride & Prejudice
"brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,",Pride & Prejudice
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of,Pride & Prejudice
having them all to dine with her.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had",Pride & Prejudice
"she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as",Pride & Prejudice
"her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her",Pride & Prejudice
"ladyship's indignation would have been. ""What would she have said? how",Pride & Prejudice
"would she have behaved?"" were questions with which she amused herself.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. ""I assure",Pride & Prejudice
"you, I feel it exceedingly,"" said Lady Catherine; ""I believe no one",Pride & Prejudice
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly,Pride & Prejudice
"attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to",Pride & Prejudice
me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The,Pride & Prejudice
dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy,Pride & Prejudice
"seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His",Pride & Prejudice
"attachment to Rosings certainly increases.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which",Pride & Prejudice
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of",Pride & Prejudice
"spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that",Pride & Prejudice
"she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that",Pride & Prejudice
you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your,Pride & Prejudice
"company, I am sure.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"" replied",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, ""but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town",Pride & Prejudice
"next Saturday.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected",Pride & Prejudice
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There,Pride & Prejudice
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly,Pride & Prejudice
"spare you for another fortnight.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters",Pride & Prejudice
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay,Pride & Prejudice
"another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as",Pride & Prejudice
"far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as",Pride & Prejudice
"Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room",Pride & Prejudice
"for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I",Pride & Prejudice
"should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"Lady Catherine seemed resigned. ""Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant",Pride & Prejudice
"with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea",Pride & Prejudice
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.,Pride & Prejudice
You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in,Pride & Prejudice
the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly,Pride & Prejudice
"guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my",Pride & Prejudice
"niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her",Pride & Prejudice
"having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with",Pride & Prejudice
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those,Pride & Prejudice
"things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I",Pride & Prejudice
am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be,Pride & Prejudice
"discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My uncle is to send a servant for us.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you",Pride & Prejudice
have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?,Pride & Prejudice
"Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be",Pride & Prejudice
"attended to.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,",Pride & Prejudice
"and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,",Pride & Prejudice
"which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so",Pride & Prejudice
"occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be",Pride & Prejudice
"reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it",Pride & Prejudice
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary,Pride & Prejudice
"walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant",Pride & Prejudice
recollections.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She,Pride & Prejudice
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at,Pride & Prejudice
"times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,",Pride & Prejudice
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly,Pride & Prejudice
"she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against",Pride & Prejudice
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.,Pride & Prejudice
"His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she",Pride & Prejudice
"could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,",Pride & Prejudice
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past,Pride & Prejudice
"behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in",Pride & Prejudice
"the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.",Pride & Prejudice
"They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at",Pride & Prejudice
"them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his",Pride & Prejudice
"youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right",Pride & Prejudice
"herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently",Pride & Prejudice
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine,Pride & Prejudice
"and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,",Pride & Prejudice
"what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,",Pride & Prejudice
"irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always",Pride & Prejudice
"affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would",Pride & Prejudice
"scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While",Pride & Prejudice
"there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while",Pride & Prejudice
"Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there",Pride & Prejudice
forever.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's,Pride & Prejudice
"explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,",Pride & Prejudice
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved,Pride & Prejudice
"to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any",Pride & Prejudice
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How,Pride & Prejudice
"grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every",Pride & Prejudice
"respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had",Pride & Prejudice
"been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's,Pride & Prejudice
"character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had",Pride & Prejudice
"seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it",Pride & Prejudice
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of,Pride & Prejudice
her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent,Pride & Prejudice
there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of,Pride & Prejudice
"their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,",Pride & Prejudice
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right,Pride & Prejudice
"way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the",Pride & Prejudice
"work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them",Pride & Prejudice
"a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;",Pride & Prejudice

hand to both.,Pride & Prejudice

On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few,Pride & Prejudice
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of,Pride & Prejudice
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I know not, Miss Elizabeth,"" said he, ""whether Mrs. Collins has yet",Pride & Prejudice
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very,Pride & Prejudice
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for,Pride & Prejudice
"it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We",Pride & Prejudice
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain,Pride & Prejudice
"manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we",Pride & Prejudice
"see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like",Pride & Prejudice
"yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,",Pride & Prejudice
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending,Pride & Prejudice
"your time unpleasantly.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She,Pride & Prejudice
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with,Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_",Pride & Prejudice
"feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling",Pride & Prejudice
solemnity replied:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not",Pride & Prejudice
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately,Pride & Prejudice
"having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,",Pride & Prejudice
"from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the",Pride & Prejudice
"humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford",Pride & Prejudice
visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to,Pride & Prejudice
Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage,Pride & Prejudice
and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You,Pride & Prejudice
see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge,Pride & Prejudice
"that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should",Pride & Prejudice
"not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are",Pride & Prejudice
"sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was,Pride & Prejudice
"obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility",Pride & Prejudice
and truth in a few short sentences.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into",Pride & Prejudice
"Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will",Pride & Prejudice
be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you,Pride & Prejudice
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear,Pride & Prejudice
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be,Pride & Prejudice
"as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,",Pride & Prejudice
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in,Pride & Prejudice
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of,Pride & Prejudice
thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of,Pride & Prejudice
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each,Pride & Prejudice
"other.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was,Pride & Prejudice
"the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed",Pride & Prejudice
"and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to",Pride & Prejudice
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.,Pride & Prejudice
Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she,Pride & Prejudice
had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that,Pride & Prejudice
"her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her",Pride & Prejudice
"home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their",Pride & Prejudice
"dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels",Pride & Prejudice
"placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate",Pride & Prejudice
"parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her",Pride & Prejudice
"with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks",Pride & Prejudice
"for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his",Pride & Prejudice
"compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her",Pride & Prejudice
"in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,",Pride & Prejudice

Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!,Pride & Prejudice
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would,Pride & Prejudice
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece,Pride & Prejudice
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend,Pride & Prejudice
"the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the",Pride & Prejudice
"evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so",Pride & Prejudice
"she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen",Pride & Prejudice
"was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We",Pride & Prejudice
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a,Pride & Prejudice
"lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow",Pride & Prejudice
"one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,",Pride & Prejudice
"and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they",Pride & Prejudice
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect,Pride & Prejudice
"something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did",Pride & Prejudice
"Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her",Pride & Prejudice
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she,Pride & Prejudice
"could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane,Pride & Prejudice
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet,Pride & Prejudice
say voluntarily to Elizabeth:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases",Pride & Prejudice
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that,Pride & Prejudice
"occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and",Pride & Prejudice
"poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one",Pride & Prejudice
"hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat",Pride & Prejudice
"some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger",Pride & Prejudice
"Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,",Pride & Prejudice
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who,Pride & Prejudice
would hear her.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! Mary,"" said she, ""I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!",Pride & Prejudice
"As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there",Pride & Prejudice
"was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty",Pride & Prejudice
"had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved",Pride & Prejudice
"very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold",Pride & Prejudice
"luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated",Pride & Prejudice
you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never,Pride & Prejudice
should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then,Pride & Prejudice
"we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that",Pride & Prejudice
"anybody might have heard us ten miles off!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"To this Mary very gravely replied, ""Far be it from me, my dear sister,",Pride & Prejudice
to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the,Pride & Prejudice
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for,Pride & Prejudice
"_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to,Pride & Prejudice
"anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk,Pride & Prejudice
"to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily",Pride & Prejudice
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could,Pride & Prejudice
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.,Pride & Prejudice
There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.,Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The",Pride & Prejudice
comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond,Pride & Prejudice
"expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped",Pride & Prejudice
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton,Pride & Prejudice
"scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under",Pride & Prejudice
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her,Pride & Prejudice
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were,Pride & Prejudice
"at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often",Pride & Prejudice
"disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 40,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could,Pride & Prejudice
"no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every",Pride & Prejudice
"particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be",Pride & Prejudice
"surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene",Pride & Prejudice
between Mr. Darcy and herself.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly,Pride & Prejudice
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly,Pride & Prejudice
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was,Pride & Prejudice
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so,Pride & Prejudice
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the,Pride & Prejudice
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,"" said she, ""and certainly",Pride & Prejudice
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his,Pride & Prejudice
"disappointment!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, ""I am heartily sorry for him; but he has",Pride & Prejudice
"other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.",Pride & Prejudice
"You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Blame you! Oh, no.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next",Pride & Prejudice
"day.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far",Pride & Prejudice
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!,Pride & Prejudice
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that,Pride & Prejudice
"so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here",Pride & Prejudice
"collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though",Pride & Prejudice
"grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.",Pride & Prejudice
"Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and",Pride & Prejudice
seek to clear the one without involving the other.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""This will not do,"" said Elizabeth; ""you never will be able to make both",Pride & Prejudice
"of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied",Pride & Prejudice
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just,Pride & Prejudice
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting,Pride & Prejudice
"about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;",Pride & Prejudice
"but you shall do as you choose.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I do not know when I have been more shocked,"" said she. ""Wickham so",Pride & Prejudice
"very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only",Pride & Prejudice
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the,Pride & Prejudice
"knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing",Pride & Prejudice
of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it,Pride & Prejudice
"so.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so",Pride & Prejudice
"full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am",Pride & Prejudice
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion,Pride & Prejudice
"makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will",Pride & Prejudice
"be as light as a feather.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his",Pride & Prejudice
"countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those",Pride & Prejudice
"two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the",Pride & Prejudice
"appearance of it.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you",Pride & Prejudice
"used to do.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike",Pride & Prejudice
"to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an",Pride & Prejudice
"opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually",Pride & Prejudice
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing,Pride & Prejudice
"at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat",Pride & Prejudice
"the matter as you do now.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And",Pride & Prejudice
"with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say",Pride & Prejudice
that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I,Pride & Prejudice
"had! Oh! how I wanted you!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions",Pride & Prejudice
"in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly",Pride & Prejudice
"undeserved.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most",Pride & Prejudice
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There,Pride & Prejudice
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I,Pride & Prejudice
"ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham's character.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, ""Surely there can be no",Pride & Prejudice
"occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me",Pride & Prejudice
"to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular",Pride & Prejudice
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to,Pride & Prejudice
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his,Pride & Prejudice
"conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy",Pride & Prejudice
"is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in",Pride & Prejudice
Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal,Pride & Prejudice
to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to,Pride & Prejudice
"anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,",Pride & Prejudice
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At,Pride & Prejudice
"present I will say nothing about it.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for",Pride & Prejudice
"ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to",Pride & Prejudice
"re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had,Pride & Prejudice
"got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,",Pride & Prejudice
"and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish",Pride & Prejudice
"to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,",Pride & Prejudice
of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other,Pride & Prejudice
"half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she",Pride & Prejudice
had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one,Pride & Prejudice
could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect,Pride & Prejudice
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off,Pride & Prejudice
"this last encumbrance of mystery. ""And then,"" said she, ""if that very",Pride & Prejudice
"improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to",Pride & Prejudice
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The,Pride & Prejudice
"liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real",Pride & Prejudice
state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a,Pride & Prejudice
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself,Pride & Prejudice
"in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,",Pride & Prejudice
"and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first",Pride & Prejudice
"attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,",Pride & Prejudice
"and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her",Pride & Prejudice
"attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the",Pride & Prejudice
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own,Pride & Prejudice
health and their tranquillity.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Well, Lizzy,"" said Mrs. Bennet one day, ""what is your opinion _now_ of",Pride & Prejudice
"this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak",Pride & Prejudice
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But,Pride & Prejudice
"I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is",Pride & Prejudice
a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least,Pride & Prejudice
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of,Pride & Prejudice
his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of,Pride & Prejudice
"everybody, too, who is likely to know.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I",Pride & Prejudice
"shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I",Pride & Prejudice
"would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will",Pride & Prejudice
"die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,",Pride & Prejudice
she made no answer.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Well, Lizzy,"" continued her mother, soon afterwards, ""and so the",Pride & Prejudice
"Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope",Pride & Prejudice
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an,Pride & Prejudice
"excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her",Pride & Prejudice
"mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_",Pride & Prejudice
"housekeeping, I dare say.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""No, nothing at all.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will",Pride & Prejudice
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed,Pride & Prejudice
"for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often",Pride & Prejudice
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as,Pride & Prejudice
"quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""It was a subject which they could not mention before me.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they",Pride & Prejudice
"often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an",Pride & Prejudice

"ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.""",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was,Pride & Prejudice
"the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies",Pride & Prejudice
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost,Pride & Prejudice
"universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,",Pride & Prejudice
"and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very",Pride & Prejudice
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and,Pride & Prejudice
"Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such",Pride & Prejudice
hard-heartedness in any of the family.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?"" would they",Pride & Prejudice
"often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. ""How can you be smiling so,",Pride & Prejudice
"Lizzy?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what,Pride & Prejudice
"she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years",Pride & Prejudice
ago.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am sure,"" said she, ""I cried for two days together when Colonel",Pride & Prejudice
"Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am sure I shall break _mine_,"" said Lydia.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""If one could but go to Brighton!"" observed Mrs. Bennet.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so",Pride & Prejudice
"disagreeable.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,""",Pride & Prejudice
added Kitty.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through,Pride & Prejudice
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense,Pride & Prejudice
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's,Pride & Prejudice
objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his,Pride & Prejudice
interference in the views of his friend.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she,Pride & Prejudice
"received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of",Pride & Prejudice
"the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a",Pride & Prejudice
"very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour",Pride & Prejudice
"and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of",Pride & Prejudice
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,",Pride & Prejudice
"the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely",Pride & Prejudice
"to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia",Pride & Prejudice
"flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's",Pride & Prejudice
"congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;",Pride & Prejudice
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate,Pride & Prejudice
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,""",Pride & Prejudice
"said she, ""Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much",Pride & Prejudice
"right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make",Pride & Prejudice
"her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from",Pride & Prejudice
"exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she",Pride & Prejudice
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense,Pride & Prejudice
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it,Pride & Prejudice
"known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her",Pride & Prejudice
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general,Pride & Prejudice
"behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of",Pride & Prejudice
"such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more",Pride & Prejudice
"imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must",Pride & Prejudice
"be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public",Pride & Prejudice
"place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so",Pride & Prejudice
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present,Pride & Prejudice
"circumstances.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""If you were aware,"" said Elizabeth, ""of the very great disadvantage to",Pride & Prejudice
us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and,Pride & Prejudice
"imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you",Pride & Prejudice
"would judge differently in the affair.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Already arisen?"" repeated Mr. Bennet. ""What, has she frightened away",Pride & Prejudice
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such,Pride & Prejudice
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,Pride & Prejudice
"are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who",Pride & Prejudice
"have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not",Pride & Prejudice
"of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our",Pride & Prejudice
"importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the",Pride & Prejudice
"wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark",Pride & Prejudice
"Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear",Pride & Prejudice
"father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and",Pride & Prejudice
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of,Pride & Prejudice
"her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character",Pride & Prejudice
"will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt",Pride & Prejudice
"that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the",Pride & Prejudice
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond,Pride & Prejudice
"youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness",Pride & Prejudice
"of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal",Pride & Prejudice
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger,Pride & Prejudice
"Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,",Pride & Prejudice
"ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you",Pride & Prejudice
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever,Pride & Prejudice
"they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the",Pride & Prejudice
"disgrace?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and",Pride & Prejudice
affectionately taking her hand said in reply:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known",Pride & Prejudice
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less,Pride & Prejudice
"advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly",Pride & Prejudice
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to,Pride & Prejudice
"Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will",Pride & Prejudice
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an,Pride & Prejudice
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance,Pride & Prejudice
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find,Pride & Prejudice
"women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being",Pride & Prejudice
"there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow",Pride & Prejudice
"many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest",Pride & Prejudice
"of her life.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion,Pride & Prejudice
"continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not",Pride & Prejudice
"in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on",Pride & Prejudice
"them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret",Pride & Prejudice
"over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her",Pride & Prejudice
disposition.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her,Pride & Prejudice
"father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their",Pride & Prejudice
"united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised",Pride & Prejudice
"every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye",Pride & Prejudice
"of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.",Pride & Prejudice
"She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them",Pride & Prejudice
at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents,Pride & Prejudice
"stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young",Pride & Prejudice
"and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she",Pride & Prejudice
"saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six",Pride & Prejudice
officers at once.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such,Pride & Prejudice
"realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have",Pride & Prejudice
"been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.",Pride & Prejudice
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy,Pride & Prejudice
conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures,Pride & Prejudice
"continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving",Pride & Prejudice
home.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been,Pride & Prejudice
"frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty",Pride & Prejudice
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even,Pride & Prejudice
"learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted",Pride & Prejudice
"her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present",Pride & Prejudice
"behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,",Pride & Prejudice
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which,Pride & Prejudice
"had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after",Pride & Prejudice
"what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in",Pride & Prejudice
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous,Pride & Prejudice
"gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the",Pride & Prejudice
"reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever",Pride & Prejudice
"cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,",Pride & Prejudice
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,",Pride & Prejudice
"with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth",Pride & Prejudice
"disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some",Pride & Prejudice
"inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she",Pride & Prejudice
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three,Pride & Prejudice
"weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's",Pride & Prejudice
"recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen",Pride & Prejudice
"him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,",Pride & Prejudice
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.,Pride & Prejudice
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""How long did you say he was at Rosings?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Nearly three weeks.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And you saw him frequently?""",Pride & Prejudice

"""Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Indeed!"" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. ""And",Pride & Prejudice
"pray, may I ask?--"" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, ""Is",Pride & Prejudice
it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility,Pride & Prejudice

"and more serious tone, ""that he is improved in essentials.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh, no!"" said Elizabeth. ""In essentials, I believe, he is very much",Pride & Prejudice
"what he ever was.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to",Pride & Prejudice
"rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a",Pride & Prejudice
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive,Pride & Prejudice
"and anxious attention, while she added:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that",Pride & Prejudice
"his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from",Pride & Prejudice
"knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated,Pride & Prejudice
"look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his",Pride & Prejudice
"embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of",Pride & Prejudice
accents:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily",Pride & Prejudice
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume,Pride & Prejudice
"even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,",Pride & Prejudice
"may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only",Pride & Prejudice
deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only,Pride & Prejudice
"fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been",Pride & Prejudice
"alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good",Pride & Prejudice
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always,Pride & Prejudice
"operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be",Pride & Prejudice
"imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I",Pride & Prejudice
"am certain he has very much at heart.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a",Pride & Prejudice
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on,Pride & Prejudice
"the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge",Pride & Prejudice
"him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his",Pride & Prejudice
"side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a",Pride & Prejudice
mutual desire of never meeting again.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,",Pride & Prejudice
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation,Pride & Prejudice
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the,Pride & Prejudice
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,",Pride & Prejudice
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the,Pride & Prejudice
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which,Pride & Prejudice
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in,Pride & Prejudice
"the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more",Pride & Prejudice
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 42,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could",Pride & Prejudice
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic,Pride & Prejudice
"comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance",Pride & Prejudice
"of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a",Pride & Prejudice
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in,Pride & Prejudice
"their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,",Pride & Prejudice
"esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views",Pride & Prejudice
of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of,Pride & Prejudice
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own,Pride & Prejudice
"imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often",Pride & Prejudice
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of,Pride & Prejudice
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal,Pride & Prejudice
"enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as",Pride & Prejudice
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not,Pride & Prejudice
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his,Pride & Prejudice
"wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true",Pride & Prejudice
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her",Pride & Prejudice
father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but,Pride & Prejudice
"respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of",Pride & Prejudice
"herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to",Pride & Prejudice
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation,Pride & Prejudice
"and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own",Pride & Prejudice
"children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so",Pride & Prejudice
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so,Pride & Prejudice
"unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising",Pride & Prejudice
"from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,",Pride & Prejudice
"might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even",Pride & Prejudice
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little,Pride & Prejudice
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties,Pride & Prejudice
"abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and",Pride & Prejudice
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around,Pride & Prejudice
"them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty",Pride & Prejudice
"might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers",Pride & Prejudice
"of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition",Pride & Prejudice
"greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all",Pride & Prejudice
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a,Pride & Prejudice
"watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what",Pride & Prejudice
"has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been",Pride & Prejudice
"looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the",Pride & Prejudice
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to,Pride & Prejudice
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have,Pride & Prejudice
"some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by",Pride & Prejudice
"again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the",Pride & Prejudice
"present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes",Pride & Prejudice
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation,Pride & Prejudice
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother,Pride & Prejudice
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the,Pride & Prejudice
"scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But it is fortunate,"" thought she, ""that I have something to wish for.",Pride & Prejudice
"Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.",Pride & Prejudice
"But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my",Pride & Prejudice
"sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of",Pride & Prejudice
pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can,Pride & Prejudice
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by,Pride & Prejudice
"the defence of some little peculiar vexation.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely,Pride & Prejudice
"to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and",Pride & Prejudice
always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that,Pride & Prejudice
"they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers",Pride & Prejudice
"had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as",Pride & Prejudice
"made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which",Pride & Prejudice
"she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a",Pride & Prejudice
"violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to",Pride & Prejudice
"the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still",Pride & Prejudice
"less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were",Pride & Prejudice
much too full of lines under the words to be made public.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good",Pride & Prejudice
"humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore",Pride & Prejudice
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came,Pride & Prejudice
"back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet",Pride & Prejudice
"was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of",Pride & Prejudice
"June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without",Pride & Prejudice
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by,Pride & Prejudice
the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to,Pride & Prejudice
"mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious",Pride & Prejudice
"arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in",Pride & Prejudice
Meryton.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast,Pride & Prejudice
"approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter",Pride & Prejudice
"arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and",Pride & Prejudice
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from,Pride & Prejudice
"setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again",Pride & Prejudice
"within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so",Pride & Prejudice
"far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with",Pride & Prejudice
"the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up",Pride & Prejudice
"the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the",Pride & Prejudice
"present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that",Pride & Prejudice
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three,Pride & Prejudice
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The,Pride & Prejudice
"town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where",Pride & Prejudice
"they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of",Pride & Prejudice
"her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,",Pride & Prejudice
"Dovedale, or the Peak.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing,Pride & Prejudice
"the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it",Pride & Prejudice
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;,Pride & Prejudice
and all was soon right again.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was,Pride & Prejudice
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its,Pride & Prejudice
"owner. ""But surely,"" said she, ""I may enter his county with impunity,",Pride & Prejudice
"and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away,Pride & Prejudice
"before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at",Pride & Prejudice
"Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two",Pride & Prejudice
"younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their",Pride & Prejudice
"cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and",Pride & Prejudice
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every,Pride & Prejudice
"way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the",Pride & Prejudice
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.,Pride & Prejudice
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;,Pride & Prejudice
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear,Pride & Prejudice
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection,Pride & Prejudice
"and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were",Pride & Prejudice
disappointments abroad.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,",Pride & Prejudice
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither,Pride & Prejudice
"lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are",Pride & Prejudice
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present,Pride & Prejudice
"concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's",Pride & Prejudice
"former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance",Pride & Prejudice
"still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the",Pride & Prejudice
"principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not,Pride & Prejudice
"in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In",Pride & Prejudice
"talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed",Pride & Prejudice
an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his,Pride & Prejudice
"willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard",Pride & Prejudice
"so much?"" said her aunt; ""a place, too, with which so many of your",Pride & Prejudice
"acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you",Pride & Prejudice
"know.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at,Pride & Prejudice
"Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She",Pride & Prejudice
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so,Pride & Prejudice
"many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. ""If it were merely a fine house",Pride & Prejudice
"richly furnished,"" said she, ""I should not care about it myself; but",Pride & Prejudice
the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the,Pride & Prejudice
"country.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The,Pride & Prejudice
"possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly",Pride & Prejudice
"occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and",Pride & Prejudice
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such,Pride & Prejudice
a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved,Pride & Prejudice
"that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the",Pride & Prejudice
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid",Pride & Prejudice
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its,Pride & Prejudice
"proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for",Pride & Prejudice
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her,Pride & Prejudice
"alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of",Pride & Prejudice
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the,Pride & Prejudice
"next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and",Pride & Prejudice
"with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike",Pride & Prejudice
"to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 43,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of",Pride & Prejudice
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned,Pride & Prejudice
"in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They",Pride & Prejudice
"entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through",Pride & Prejudice
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired",Pride & Prejudice
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for,Pride & Prejudice
"half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable",Pride & Prejudice
"eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by",Pride & Prejudice
"Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which",Pride & Prejudice
"the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone",Pride & Prejudice
"building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of",Pride & Prejudice
"high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was",Pride & Prejudice
"swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks",Pride & Prejudice
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She,Pride & Prejudice
"had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural",Pride & Prejudice
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were,Pride & Prejudice
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that,Pride & Prejudice
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,",Pride & Prejudice
"while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of",Pride & Prejudice
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been,Pride & Prejudice
"mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the",Pride & Prejudice
"hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to",Pride & Prejudice
wonder at her being where she was.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less",Pride & Prejudice
"fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They",Pride & Prejudice
"followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned",Pride & Prejudice
"room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went",Pride & Prejudice
"to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which",Pride & Prejudice
"they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,",Pride & Prejudice
was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and,Pride & Prejudice
"she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its",Pride & Prejudice
"banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,",Pride & Prejudice
with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking,Pride & Prejudice
different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be,Pride & Prejudice
"seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to",Pride & Prejudice
"the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of",Pride & Prejudice
"his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of",Pride & Prejudice
"splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And of this place,"" thought she, ""I might have been mistress! With",Pride & Prejudice
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of,Pride & Prejudice
"viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and",Pride & Prejudice
"welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,""--recollecting",Pride & Prejudice
"herself--""that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to",Pride & Prejudice
"me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like,Pride & Prejudice
regret.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really,Pride & Prejudice
"absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question",Pride & Prejudice
"was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Reynolds replied that he was, adding, ""But we expect him to-morrow, with",Pride & Prejudice
"a large party of friends."" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own",Pride & Prejudice
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the,Pride & Prejudice
"likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,",Pride & Prejudice
"over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.",Pride & Prejudice
"The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young",Pride & Prejudice
"gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought",Pride & Prejudice
"up by him at his own expense. ""He is now gone into the army,"" she added;",Pride & Prejudice
"""but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not",Pride & Prejudice
return it.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And that,"" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,",Pride & Prejudice
"""is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the",Pride & Prejudice
"other--about eight years ago.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I have heard much of your master's fine person,"" said Mrs. Gardiner,",Pride & Prejudice
"looking at the picture; ""it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell",Pride & Prejudice
"us whether it is like or not.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this,Pride & Prejudice
intimation of her knowing her master.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth coloured, and said: ""A little.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes, very handsome.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you",Pride & Prejudice
"will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late",Pride & Prejudice
"master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to",Pride & Prejudice
"be then. He was very fond of them.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn",Pride & Prejudice
when she was only eight years old.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?"" said Mrs. Gardiner.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so",Pride & Prejudice
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is,Pride & Prejudice
a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she,Pride & Prejudice
"comes here to-morrow with him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her",Pride & Prejudice
"communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either",Pride & Prejudice
"by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her",Pride & Prejudice
master and his sister.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his",Pride & Prejudice
"time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Except,"" thought Elizabeth, ""when she goes to Ramsgate.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""If your master would marry, you might see more of him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is",Pride & Prejudice
"good enough for him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, ""It is",Pride & Prejudice
"very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,""",Pride & Prejudice
replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she,Pride & Prejudice
"listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, ""I have",Pride & Prejudice
"never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever",Pride & Prejudice
"since he was four years old.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her",Pride & Prejudice
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.,Pride & Prejudice
"Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was",Pride & Prejudice
grateful to her uncle for saying:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in",Pride & Prejudice
"having such a master.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could",Pride & Prejudice
"not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are",Pride & Prejudice
"good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and",Pride & Prejudice
"he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the",Pride & Prejudice
"world.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth almost stared at her. ""Can this be Mr. Darcy?"" thought she.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""His father was an excellent man,"" said Mrs. Gardiner.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just",Pride & Prejudice
"as affable to the poor.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects,Pride & Prejudice
"of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the",Pride & Prejudice
"furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family",Pride & Prejudice
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her,Pride & Prejudice
"master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his",Pride & Prejudice
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""He is the best landlord, and the best master,"" said she, ""that ever",Pride & Prejudice
"lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but",Pride & Prejudice
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give,Pride & Prejudice
him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw,Pride & Prejudice
"anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away",Pride & Prejudice
"like other young men.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""In what an amiable light does this place him!"" thought Elizabeth.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""This fine account of him,"" whispered her aunt as they walked, ""is not",Pride & Prejudice
"quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Perhaps we might be deceived.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""That is not very likely; our authority was too good.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty,Pride & Prejudice
"sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than",Pride & Prejudice
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to,Pride & Prejudice
"give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when",Pride & Prejudice
last at Pemberley.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""He is certainly a good brother,"" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards",Pride & Prejudice
one of the windows.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter",Pride & Prejudice
"the room. ""And this is always the way with him,"" she added. ""Whatever",Pride & Prejudice
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There,Pride & Prejudice
"is nothing he would not do for her.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were",Pride & Prejudice
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;,Pride & Prejudice
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already,Pride & Prejudice
"visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and",Pride & Prejudice
also more intelligible.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have",Pride & Prejudice
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of,Pride & Prejudice
the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested,Pride & Prejudice
"her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a",Pride & Prejudice
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he,Pride & Prejudice
"looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest",Pride & Prejudice
"contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.",Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's,Pride & Prejudice
lifetime.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle",Pride & Prejudice
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of,Pride & Prejudice
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds,Pride & Prejudice
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise,Pride & Prejudice
"of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she",Pride & Prejudice
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how,Pride & Prejudice
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of,Pride & Prejudice
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought,Pride & Prejudice
"forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she",Pride & Prejudice
"stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his",Pride & Prejudice
"eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of",Pride & Prejudice
"gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and",Pride & Prejudice
softened its impropriety of expression.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,",Pride & Prejudice
"they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were",Pride & Prejudice
"consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back",Pride & Prejudice
"to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former",Pride & Prejudice
"was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself",Pride & Prejudice
"suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his",Pride & Prejudice
"appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes",Pride & Prejudice
"instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest",Pride & Prejudice
"blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from",Pride & Prejudice
"surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,",Pride & Prejudice
"and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least",Pride & Prejudice
of perfect civility.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,",Pride & Prejudice
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be,Pride & Prejudice
"overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture",Pride & Prejudice
"they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two",Pride & Prejudice
"that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on",Pride & Prejudice
"beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little",Pride & Prejudice
"aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,",Pride & Prejudice
"scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer",Pride & Prejudice
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the,Pride & Prejudice
"alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that",Pride & Prejudice
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the,Pride & Prejudice
"impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few",Pride & Prejudice
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in,Pride & Prejudice
"her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent",Pride & Prejudice
had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as,Pride & Prejudice
"to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in",Pride & Prejudice
"Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the",Pride & Prejudice
distraction of his thoughts.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few",Pride & Prejudice
"moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took",Pride & Prejudice
leave.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,",Pride & Prejudice
followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her,Pride & Prejudice
"coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the",Pride & Prejudice
world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light,Pride & Prejudice
might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely,Pride & Prejudice
"thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he",Pride & Prejudice
thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes,Pride & Prejudice
"sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;",Pride & Prejudice
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted,Pride & Prejudice
from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over,Pride & Prejudice
"the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly",Pride & Prejudice
altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was,Pride & Prejudice
"amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!",Pride & Prejudice
"Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never",Pride & Prejudice
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What,Pride & Prejudice
"a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put",Pride & Prejudice
"his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account",Pride & Prejudice
for it.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and",Pride & Prejudice
"every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer",Pride & Prejudice
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time,Pride & Prejudice
"before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered",Pride & Prejudice
"mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and",Pride & Prejudice
"seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she",Pride & Prejudice
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that,Pride & Prejudice
"one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then",Pride & Prejudice
was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in,Pride & Prejudice
"what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,",Pride & Prejudice
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he,Pride & Prejudice
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was,Pride & Prejudice
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in,Pride & Prejudice
"seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with",Pride & Prejudice
composure.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind",Pride & Prejudice
"aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,",Pride & Prejudice
"ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of",Pride & Prejudice
"the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the",Pride & Prejudice
"valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading",Pride & Prejudice
"many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish",Pride & Prejudice
"of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.",Pride & Prejudice
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.,Pride & Prejudice
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which,Pride & Prejudice
"brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,",Pride & Prejudice
"to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed",Pride & Prejudice
"it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;",Pride & Prejudice
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the,Pride & Prejudice
"valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,",Pride & Prejudice
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the,Pride & Prejudice
"bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,",Pride & Prejudice
"who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only",Pride & Prejudice
"of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,",Pride & Prejudice
"therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house",Pride & Prejudice
"on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their",Pride & Prejudice
"progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the",Pride & Prejudice
"taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the",Pride & Prejudice
"occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the",Pride & Prejudice
"man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this",Pride & Prejudice
"slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment",Pride & Prejudice
"was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy",Pride & Prejudice
"approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here",Pride & Prejudice
"less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before",Pride & Prejudice
"they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared",Pride & Prejudice
"for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with",Pride & Prejudice
"calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,",Pride & Prejudice
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea,Pride & Prejudice
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the,Pride & Prejudice
"turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw",Pride & Prejudice
"that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his",Pride & Prejudice
"politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;",Pride & Prejudice
"but she had not got beyond the words ""delightful,"" and ""charming,"" when",Pride & Prejudice
"some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of",Pride & Prejudice
"Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,",Pride & Prejudice
and she said no more.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked",Pride & Prejudice
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.,Pride & Prejudice
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;,Pride & Prejudice
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the,Pride & Prejudice
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had,Pride & Prejudice
"revolted in his offer to herself. ""What will be his surprise,"" thought",Pride & Prejudice
"she, ""when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of",Pride & Prejudice
"fashion.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their",Pride & Prejudice
"relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore",Pride & Prejudice
"it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he",Pride & Prejudice
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the,Pride & Prejudice
"connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and",Pride & Prejudice
"so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into",Pride & Prejudice
"conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,",Pride & Prejudice
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had,Pride & Prejudice
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most,Pride & Prejudice
"attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every",Pride & Prejudice
"expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,",Pride & Prejudice
"his taste, or his good manners.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy,Pride & Prejudice
"invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he",Pride & Prejudice
"chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time",Pride & Prejudice
"to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of",Pride & Prejudice
"the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was",Pride & Prejudice
"walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment",Pride & Prejudice
"must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and",Pride & Prejudice
"continually was she repeating, ""Why is he so altered? From what can",Pride & Prejudice
it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his,Pride & Prejudice
manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a,Pride & Prejudice
"change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two",Pride & Prejudice
"gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to",Pride & Prejudice
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious,Pride & Prejudice
"water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated",Pride & Prejudice
"in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred",Pride & Prejudice
"her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on",Pride & Prejudice
"together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him",Pride & Prejudice
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the,Pride & Prejudice
"place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been",Pride & Prejudice
"very unexpected--""for your housekeeper,"" she added, ""informed us that",Pride & Prejudice
"you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we",Pride & Prejudice
"left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected",Pride & Prejudice
"in the country."" He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that",Pride & Prejudice
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours,Pride & Prejudice
"before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. ""They",Pride & Prejudice
"will join me early to-morrow,"" he continued, ""and among them are some",Pride & Prejudice
"who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly,Pride & Prejudice
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last,Pride & Prejudice
"mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_",Pride & Prejudice
mind was not very differently engaged.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""There is also one other person in the party,"" he continued after a",Pride & Prejudice
"pause, ""who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow",Pride & Prejudice
"me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance",Pride & Prejudice
"during your stay at Lambton?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great,Pride & Prejudice
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt,Pride & Prejudice
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,Pride & Prejudice
"must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was",Pride & Prejudice
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made,Pride & Prejudice
him think really ill of her.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth",Pride & Prejudice
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and,Pride & Prejudice
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of,Pride & Prejudice
"the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had",Pride & Prejudice
"reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a",Pride & Prejudice
mile behind.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not,Pride & Prejudice
"tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might",Pride & Prejudice
"have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but",Pride & Prejudice
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected,Pride & Prejudice
"that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale",Pride & Prejudice
with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her,Pride & Prejudice
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was,Pride & Prejudice
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go,Pride & Prejudice
"into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and",Pride & Prejudice
they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the,Pride & Prejudice
"ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him",Pride & Prejudice
walking slowly towards the house.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them,Pride & Prejudice
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.,Pride & Prejudice
"""He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,"" said her uncle.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,"" replied her",Pride & Prejudice
"aunt, ""but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now",Pride & Prejudice
"say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I",Pride & Prejudice
"have seen nothing of it.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more",Pride & Prejudice
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such,Pride & Prejudice
"attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""To be sure, Lizzy,"" said her aunt, ""he is not so handsome as Wickham;",Pride & Prejudice
"or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features",Pride & Prejudice
are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so,Pride & Prejudice
"disagreeable?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked,Pride & Prejudice
"him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never",Pride & Prejudice
seen him so pleasant as this morning.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"" replied",Pride & Prejudice
"her uncle. ""Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him",Pride & Prejudice
"at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off",Pride & Prejudice
"his grounds.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but",Pride & Prejudice
said nothing.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""From what we have seen of him,"" continued Mrs. Gardiner, ""I really",Pride & Prejudice
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by,Pride & Prejudice
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.,Pride & Prejudice
"On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he",Pride & Prejudice
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would,Pride & Prejudice
"not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the",Pride & Prejudice
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!,Pride & Prejudice
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal,Pride & Prejudice
"master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every",Pride & Prejudice
"virtue.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of,Pride & Prejudice
"his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in",Pride & Prejudice
"as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from",Pride & Prejudice
"his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different",Pride & Prejudice
"construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In",Pride & Prejudice
"confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary",Pride & Prejudice
"transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming",Pride & Prejudice
"her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now,Pride & Prejudice
"approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to",Pride & Prejudice
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out,Pride & Prejudice
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of,Pride & Prejudice
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they,Pride & Prejudice
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former,Pride & Prejudice
"acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a",Pride & Prejudice
intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth,Pride & Prejudice
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing,Pride & Prejudice
"but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above",Pride & Prejudice
"all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Chapter 44,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit,Pride & Prejudice
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently,Pride & Prejudice
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.,Pride & Prejudice
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their,Pride & Prejudice
"arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the",Pride & Prejudice
"place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn",Pride & Prejudice
"to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a",Pride & Prejudice
"carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in",Pride & Prejudice
a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing,Pride & Prejudice
"the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her",Pride & Prejudice
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she,Pride & Prejudice
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment,Pride & Prejudice
"of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many",Pride & Prejudice
"of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on",Pride & Prejudice
"the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that",Pride & Prejudice
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a,Pride & Prejudice
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these,Pride & Prejudice
"newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite,Pride & Prejudice
"amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,",Pride & Prejudice
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much,Pride & Prejudice
"in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally",Pride & Prejudice
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked",Pride & Prejudice
"up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of",Pride & Prejudice
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction",Pride & Prejudice
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new,Pride & Prejudice
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her,Pride & Prejudice
"being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;",Pride & Prejudice
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was,Pride & Prejudice
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from,Pride & Prejudice
her beyond a monosyllable.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though",Pride & Prejudice
"little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance",Pride & Prejudice
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there,Pride & Prejudice
"was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly",Pride & Prejudice
"unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as",Pride & Prejudice
"acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much",Pride & Prejudice
relieved by discerning such different feelings.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley,Pride & Prejudice
was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her,Pride & Prejudice
"satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick",Pride & Prejudice
"step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All",Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still,Pride & Prejudice
"felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected",Pride & Prejudice
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He,Pride & Prejudice
"inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked",Pride & Prejudice
and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage,Pride & Prejudice
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before,Pride & Prejudice
"them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just",Pride & Prejudice
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards,Pride & Prejudice
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from,Pride & Prejudice
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew,Pride & Prejudice
what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little,Pride & Prejudice
in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was,Pride & Prejudice
evident enough.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the",Pride & Prejudice
"feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and",Pride & Prejudice
"to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she",Pride & Prejudice
"feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she",Pride & Prejudice
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley,Pride & Prejudice
"was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!",Pride & Prejudice
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in,Pride & Prejudice
a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on,Pride & Prejudice
"former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion",Pride & Prejudice
"that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,",Pride & Prejudice
"though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his",Pride & Prejudice
"behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look",Pride & Prejudice
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred,Pride & Prejudice
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point,Pride & Prejudice
she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred,Pride & Prejudice
"ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a",Pride & Prejudice
"recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying",Pride & Prejudice
"more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed",Pride & Prejudice
"to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone",Pride & Prejudice
"which had something of real regret, that it ""was a very long time since",Pride & Prejudice
"he had had the pleasure of seeing her;"" and, before she could reply,",Pride & Prejudice
"he added, ""It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of",Pride & Prejudice
"November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards,Pride & Prejudice
"took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether",Pride & Prejudice
"_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,",Pride & Prejudice
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which,Pride & Prejudice
gave them meaning.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;,Pride & Prejudice
"but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general",Pride & Prejudice
"complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed",Pride & Prejudice
"from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that",Pride & Prejudice
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however,Pride & Prejudice
"temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When",Pride & Prejudice
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion,Pride & Prejudice
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a,Pride & Prejudice
"disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the",Pride & Prejudice
"very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last",Pride & Prejudice
"lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was",Pride & Prejudice
"so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly",Pride & Prejudice
"restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company",Pride & Prejudice
"of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations",Pride & Prejudice
"at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from",Pride & Prejudice
"self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance",Pride & Prejudice
"could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the",Pride & Prejudice
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw,Pride & Prejudice
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and,Pride & Prejudice
Rosings.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose,Pride & Prejudice
"to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing",Pride & Prejudice
"their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner",Pride & Prejudice
"at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a",Pride & Prejudice
"diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,",Pride & Prejudice
"readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing",Pride & Prejudice
"how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its",Pride & Prejudice
"acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,",Pride & Prejudice
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than,Pride & Prejudice
"any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of",Pride & Prejudice
"society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for",Pride & Prejudice
"her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth,Pride & Prejudice
"again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to",Pride & Prejudice
"make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all",Pride & Prejudice
"this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on",Pride & Prejudice
"this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their",Pride & Prejudice
"visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some",Pride & Prejudice
"satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been",Pride & Prejudice
"little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her",Pride & Prejudice
"uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their",Pride & Prejudice
"favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was,Pride & Prejudice
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was,Pride & Prejudice
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;,Pride & Prejudice
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to,Pride & Prejudice
"interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far",Pride & Prejudice
"as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could",Pride & Prejudice
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character,Pride & Prejudice
"from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference",Pride & Prejudice
"to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known",Pride & Prejudice
"would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,",Pride & Prejudice
"however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible",Pride & Prejudice
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four,Pride & Prejudice
"years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be",Pride & Prejudice
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of,Pride & Prejudice
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had,Pride & Prejudice
"nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,",Pride & Prejudice
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town,Pride & Prejudice
"where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he",Pride & Prejudice
"was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held",Pride & Prejudice
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the,Pride & Prejudice
"son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known",Pride & Prejudice
"fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind",Pride & Prejudice
"him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than",Pride & Prejudice
"the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not",Pride & Prejudice
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;,Pride & Prejudice
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She,Pride & Prejudice
"certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she",Pride & Prejudice
"had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,",Pride & Prejudice
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his,Pride & Prejudice
"valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some",Pride & Prejudice
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened,Pride & Prejudice
"into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in",Pride & Prejudice
"his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,",Pride & Prejudice
"which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,",Pride & Prejudice
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.,Pride & Prejudice
"It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,",Pride & Prejudice
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and,Pride & Prejudice
"acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations",Pride & Prejudice
"accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid",Pride & Prejudice
"her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most",Pride & Prejudice
"eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display",Pride & Prejudice
"of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only",Pride & Prejudice
"were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent",Pride & Prejudice
on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much,Pride & Prejudice
"pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent",Pride & Prejudice
"love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a",Pride & Prejudice
"sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be",Pride & Prejudice
"exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,",Pride & Prejudice
she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how,Pride & Prejudice
"far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would",Pride & Prejudice
"be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her",Pride & Prejudice
"fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of",Pride & Prejudice
his addresses.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that",Pride & Prejudice
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the,Pride & Prejudice
"very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a",Pride & Prejudice
"late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,",Pride & Prejudice
"by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that",Pride & Prejudice
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following,Pride & Prejudice
"morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when",Pride & Prejudice
"she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been,Pride & Prejudice
"renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting",Pride & Prejudice
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.,Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 45,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had,Pride & Prejudice
"originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her",Pride & Prejudice
"appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how",Pride & Prejudice
much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,",Pride & Prejudice
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,Pride & Prejudice
"opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody",Pride & Prejudice
"hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts",Pride & Prejudice
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there",Pride & Prejudice
"with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in",Pride & Prejudice
"London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with",Pride & Prejudice
"all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear",Pride & Prejudice
"of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior",Pride & Prejudice
"the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,",Pride & Prejudice
"however, did her justice, and pitied her.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,",Pride & Prejudice
"on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,",Pride & Prejudice
"succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a",Pride & Prejudice
"genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind",Pride & Prejudice
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the,Pride & Prejudice
"others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she",Pride & Prejudice
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a,Pride & Prejudice
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,",Pride & Prejudice
"and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without",Pride & Prejudice
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her,Pride & Prejudice
"from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an",Pride & Prejudice
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity,Pride & Prejudice
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every,Pride & Prejudice
"moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she",Pride & Prejudice
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether,Pride & Prejudice
"she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After",Pride & Prejudice
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss,Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold",Pride & Prejudice
inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal,Pride & Prejudice
"indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the,Pride & Prejudice
"entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the",Pride & Prejudice
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many,Pride & Prejudice
a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been,Pride & Prejudice
"given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole",Pride & Prejudice
"party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the",Pride & Prejudice
"beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected",Pride & Prejudice
them round the table.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether",Pride & Prejudice
"she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the",Pride & Prejudice
"feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but",Pride & Prejudice
"a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to",Pride & Prejudice
regret that he came.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other",Pride & Prejudice
"gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him",Pride & Prejudice
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to,Pride & Prejudice
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely,Pride & Prejudice
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more,Pride & Prejudice
"necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she",Pride & Prejudice
"saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,",Pride & Prejudice
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour,Pride & Prejudice
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive,Pride & Prejudice
"curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the",Pride & Prejudice
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its,Pride & Prejudice
"objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions",Pride & Prejudice
"to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's",Pride & Prejudice
"entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he",Pride & Prejudice
"was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded",Pride & Prejudice
"as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss",Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the",Pride & Prejudice
"first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?",Pride & Prejudice
"They must be a great loss to _your_ family.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth,Pride & Prejudice
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the,Pride & Prejudice
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;,Pride & Prejudice
"but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she",Pride & Prejudice
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While,Pride & Prejudice
"she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened",Pride & Prejudice
"complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with",Pride & Prejudice
"confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what",Pride & Prejudice
"pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would",Pride & Prejudice
have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed,Pride & Prejudice
"her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies",Pride & Prejudice
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected,Pride & Prejudice
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's,Pride & Prejudice
"meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy",Pride & Prejudice
"was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections",Pride & Prejudice
"her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very",Pride & Prejudice
"wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming",Pride & Prejudice
"hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without",Pride & Prejudice
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss,Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern",Pride & Prejudice
for the welfare of his friend.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and",Pride & Prejudice
"as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able",Pride & Prejudice
"to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely",Pride & Prejudice
"recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which",Pride & Prejudice
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have,Pride & Prejudice
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above,Pride & Prejudice
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss,Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,",Pride & Prejudice
"behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's",Pride & Prejudice
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not,Pride & Prejudice
err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana,Pride & Prejudice
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When,Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to",Pride & Prejudice
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"" she",Pride & Prejudice
"cried; ""I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since",Pride & Prejudice
the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing,Pride & Prejudice
"that we should not have known her again.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented",Pride & Prejudice
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than,Pride & Prejudice
"her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the",Pride & Prejudice
summer.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""For my own part,"" she rejoined, ""I must confess that I never could",Pride & Prejudice
see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no,Pride & Prejudice
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose,Pride & Prejudice
wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are,Pride & Prejudice
"tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,",Pride & Prejudice
"which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything",Pride & Prejudice
"extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do",Pride & Prejudice
not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency,Pride & Prejudice
"without fashion, which is intolerable.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not",Pride & Prejudice
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always,Pride & Prejudice
"wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the",Pride & Prejudice
"success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a",Pride & Prejudice
"determination of making him speak, she continued:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all",Pride & Prejudice
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect,Pride & Prejudice
"your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_",Pride & Prejudice
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she,Pride & Prejudice
"seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at",Pride & Prejudice
"one time.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yes,"" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, ""but _that_",Pride & Prejudice
"was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have",Pride & Prejudice
"considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of",Pride & Prejudice
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.,Pride & Prejudice

Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their,Pride & Prejudice
"visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them",Pride & Prejudice
"both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,",Pride & Prejudice
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked,Pride & Prejudice
"of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but",Pride & Prejudice
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from,Pride & Prejudice
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been,Pride & Prejudice
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but,Pride & Prejudice
"on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the",Pride & Prejudice
"receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that",Pride & Prejudice
"it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as",Pride & Prejudice
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and,Pride & Prejudice
"her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by",Pride & Prejudice
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been,Pride & Prejudice
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their,Pride & Prejudice
"little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;",Pride & Prejudice
"but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident",Pride & Prejudice
"agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a",Pride & Prejudice
most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be,Pride & Prejudice
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.,Pride & Prejudice
"An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,",Pride & Prejudice
"from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland",Pride & Prejudice
"with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our",Pride & Prejudice
"surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am",Pride & Prejudice
"very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing",Pride & Prejudice
"to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.",Pride & Prejudice
"Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step",Pride & Prejudice
(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is,Pride & Prejudice
"disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.",Pride & Prejudice
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How,Pride & Prejudice
thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against,Pride & Prejudice
him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about,Pride & Prejudice
"twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at",Pride & Prejudice
"eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have",Pride & Prejudice
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect,Pride & Prejudice

"and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has",Pride & Prejudice
"taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone",Pride & Prejudice
"to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the",Pride & Prejudice

"never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was",Pride & Prejudice
"repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.",Pride & Prejudice
"intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,",Pride & Prejudice
"but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney",Pride & Prejudice
"coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that",Pride & Prejudice
"is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.",Pride & Prejudice

without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With,Pride & Prejudice
"the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions",Pride & Prejudice
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved,Pride & Prejudice
"for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our",Pride & Prejudice
"distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the",Pride & Prejudice
"worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make",Pride & Prejudice
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue,Pride & Prejudice
their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a,Pride & Prejudice
"young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose",Pride & Prejudice
"her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that",Pride & Prejudice
Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his,Pride & Prejudice
"head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to",Pride & Prejudice
"be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she",Pride & Prejudice
"exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And",Pride & Prejudice
"as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has",Pride & Prejudice
anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of,Pride & Prejudice
"confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you",Pride & Prejudice
"have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the",Pride & Prejudice

more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel,Pride & Prejudice

I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any,Pride & Prejudice
"measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to",Pride & Prejudice

He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for,Pride & Prejudice

"reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only",Pride & Prejudice
"one serious, parting look, went away.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they",Pride & Prejudice
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as,Pride & Prejudice
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a,Pride & Prejudice
"retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full",Pride & Prejudice
"of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those",Pride & Prejudice
"feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would",Pride & Prejudice
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's",Pride & Prejudice
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if,Pride & Prejudice
otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or,Pride & Prejudice
"unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on",Pride & Prejudice
"a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been",Pride & Prejudice
"exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given",Pride & Prejudice
"somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,",Pride & Prejudice
"and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other",Pride & Prejudice
"less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him",Pride & Prejudice
go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must,Pride & Prejudice
"produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched",Pride & Prejudice
"business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained",Pride & Prejudice
"a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,",Pride & Prejudice
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least,Pride & Prejudice
of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first,Pride & Prejudice
"letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that",Pride & Prejudice
Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry,Pride & Prejudice
for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared,Pride & Prejudice
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment,Pride & Prejudice
as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose,Pride & Prejudice
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention,Pride & Prejudice
"of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue",Pride & Prejudice
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that",Pride & Prejudice
Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia,Pride & Prejudice
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one,Pride & Prejudice
"officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions",Pride & Prejudice
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been,Pride & Prejudice
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and,Pride & Prejudice
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now,Pride & Prejudice
feel it!,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to",Pride & Prejudice
"share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a",Pride & Prejudice
"family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and",Pride & Prejudice
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing,Pride & Prejudice
"could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost",Pride & Prejudice
"importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
"and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's",Pride & Prejudice
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them,Pride & Prejudice
"instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their",Pride & Prejudice
"summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript",Pride & Prejudice
of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a,Pride & Prejudice
"favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply",Pride & Prejudice
"afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the",Pride & Prejudice
"first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every",Pride & Prejudice
"assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked",Pride & Prejudice
"him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,",Pride & Prejudice
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to,Pride & Prejudice
"be off as soon as possible. ""But what is to be done about Pemberley?""",Pride & Prejudice
"cried Mrs. Gardiner. ""John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for",Pride & Prejudice

impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of,Pride & Prejudice
"business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to",Pride & Prejudice

"""Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other",Pride & Prejudice

"friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending",Pride & Prejudice
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He,Pride & Prejudice
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she,Pride & Prejudice
"beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,",Pride & Prejudice
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what,Pride & Prejudice
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a,Pride & Prejudice

"no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's",Pride & Prejudice
"behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever",Pride & Prejudice
"seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would",Pride & Prejudice

"tears in her eyes, ""that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such",Pride & Prejudice

Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never,Pride & Prejudice
"been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,",Pride & Prejudice

"everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give",Pride & Prejudice

was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the,Pride & Prejudice

Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;,Pride & Prejudice

"half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of",Pride & Prejudice

"did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was",Pride & Prejudice
"eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.",Pride & Prejudice

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her,Pride & Prejudice

"whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every",Pride & Prejudice

"had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,",Pride & Prejudice
"she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his",Pride & Prejudice
"letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as",Pride & Prejudice
follows:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice

"that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be",Pride & Prejudice
"guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,",Pride & Prejudice
you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined,Pride & Prejudice
"by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to",Pride & Prejudice
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that,Pride & Prejudice
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of,Pride & Prejudice
"all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,",Pride & Prejudice
will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads,Pride & Prejudice
"me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event",Pride & Prejudice
"of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved",Pride & Prejudice
"in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to",Pride & Prejudice

It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he,Pride & Prejudice
"kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one",Pride & Prejudice
living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he,Pride & Prejudice
"had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of",Pride & Prejudice
"particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,",Pride & Prejudice
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the,Pride & Prejudice
"wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for",Pride & Prejudice
"secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for",Pride & Prejudice
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a,Pride & Prejudice
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a,Pride & Prejudice
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.,Pride & Prejudice
"He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more",Pride & Prejudice
formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars,Pride & Prejudice
"from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. ""A gamester!""",Pride & Prejudice
"she cried. ""This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their",Pride & Prejudice
"father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered",Pride & Prejudice
"spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded",Pride & Prejudice
"to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and",Pride & Prejudice
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable,Pride & Prejudice
"for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did",Pride & Prejudice
"not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering",Pride & Prejudice
what her anxiety for his life had been before.,Pride & Prejudice

"As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she",Pride & Prejudice
"and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet",Pride & Prejudice
"came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their",Pride & Prejudice
"journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.",Pride & Prejudice

Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her,Pride & Prejudice

"tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware",Pride & Prejudice

"Elizabeth, ""and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall",Pride & Prejudice
"exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has",Pride & Prejudice
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never,Pride & Prejudice
"be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal",Pride & Prejudice
"protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as",Pride & Prejudice
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is,Pride & Prejudice
"actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,",Pride & Prejudice
"she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she",Pride & Prejudice
"first sees my aunt!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"" said",Pride & Prejudice
"Jane: ""I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to",Pride & Prejudice
"marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of",Pride & Prejudice
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself,Pride & Prejudice
"they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in",Pride & Prejudice
"time make their past imprudence forgotten.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Their conduct has been such,"" replied Elizabeth, ""as neither you, nor",Pride & Prejudice
"I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood,Pride & Prejudice
"perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,",Pride & Prejudice
"therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make",Pride & Prejudice
"it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly",Pride & Prejudice
replied:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Just as you please.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Take whatever you like, and get away.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs",Pride & Prejudice
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication,Pride & Prejudice
"would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,",Pride & Prejudice
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As,Pride & Prejudice
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon,Pride & Prejudice
"married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its",Pride & Prejudice
"exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she",Pride & Prejudice
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter,Pride & Prejudice
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her,Pride & Prejudice
"felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear, dear Lydia!"" she cried. ""This is delightful indeed! She will",Pride & Prejudice
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!,Pride & Prejudice
"My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage",Pride & Prejudice
everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the,Pride & Prejudice
"clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about",Pride & Prejudice
"them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him",Pride & Prejudice
"how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,",Pride & Prejudice
"Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear",Pride & Prejudice
"Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of,Pride & Prejudice
"these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.",Pride & Prejudice
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""For we must attribute this happy conclusion,"" she added, ""in a great",Pride & Prejudice
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to,Pride & Prejudice
"assist Mr. Wickham with money.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Well,"" cried her mother, ""it is all very right; who should do it but",Pride & Prejudice
"her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children",Pride & Prejudice
"must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have",Pride & Prejudice
"ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!",Pride & Prejudice
In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well,Pride & Prejudice
"it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in",Pride & Prejudice
"such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and",Pride & Prejudice
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money,Pride & Prejudice
"afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and",Pride & Prejudice
"cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had",Pride & Prejudice
"not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her",Pride & Prejudice
"father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,",Pride & Prejudice
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite,Pride & Prejudice
"so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I will go to Meryton,"" said she, ""as soon as I am dressed, and tell the",Pride & Prejudice
"good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call",Pride & Prejudice
"on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.",Pride & Prejudice
"An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do",Pride & Prejudice
"anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you",Pride & Prejudice
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall,Pride & Prejudice
"all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her,Pride & Prejudice
"congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took",Pride & Prejudice
"refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was",Pride & Prejudice
"no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in",Pride & Prejudice
"looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could",Pride & Prejudice

Chapter 50,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,",Pride & Prejudice
"instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for",Pride & Prejudice
"the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived",Pride & Prejudice
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that,Pride & Prejudice
"respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever",Pride & Prejudice
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of,Pride & Prejudice
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be,Pride & Prejudice
her husband might then have rested in its proper place.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone,Pride & Prejudice
"should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he",Pride & Prejudice
"was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,",Pride & Prejudice
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly",Pride & Prejudice
"useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join",Pride & Prejudice
"in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow",Pride & Prejudice
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters,Pride & Prejudice
"successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he",Pride & Prejudice
"would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then",Pride & Prejudice
"too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her",Pride & Prejudice
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their,Pride & Prejudice
income.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and,Pride & Prejudice
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the,Pride & Prejudice
"latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with",Pride & Prejudice
"regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet",Pride & Prejudice
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In,Pride & Prejudice
"terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,",Pride & Prejudice
"though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect",Pride & Prejudice
"approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the",Pride & Prejudice
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed,Pride & Prejudice
"that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would",Pride & Prejudice
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present,Pride & Prejudice
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the,Pride & Prejudice
"hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket",Pride & Prejudice
"allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her",Pride & Prejudice
"through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within",Pride & Prejudice
that sum.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was",Pride & Prejudice
another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as,Pride & Prejudice
little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports,Pride & Prejudice
"of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he",Pride & Prejudice
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon,Pride & Prejudice
"dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick",Pride & Prejudice
in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he,Pride & Prejudice
"was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any",Pride & Prejudice
message to her.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate",Pride & Prejudice
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent,Pride & Prejudice
"philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage",Pride & Prejudice
"of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the",Pride & Prejudice
"happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant",Pride & Prejudice
farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the,Pride & Prejudice
good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from,Pride & Prejudice
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit,Pride & Prejudice
"in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery",Pride & Prejudice
was considered certain.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this,Pride & Prejudice
"happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in",Pride & Prejudice
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her,Pride & Prejudice
"triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object",Pride & Prejudice
"of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of",Pride & Prejudice
"accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those",Pride & Prejudice
"attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and",Pride & Prejudice
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a,Pride & Prejudice
"proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering",Pride & Prejudice
"what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and",Pride & Prejudice
importance.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Haye Park might do,"" said she, ""if the Gouldings could quit it--or the",Pride & Prejudice
"great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is",Pride & Prejudice
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for,Pride & Prejudice
"Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the,Pride & Prejudice
"servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: ""Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and",Pride & Prejudice
"daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this",Pride & Prejudice
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the,Pride & Prejudice
"impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It,Pride & Prejudice
"soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,",Pride & Prejudice
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his,Pride & Prejudice
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of,Pride & Prejudice
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend,Pride & Prejudice
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable,Pride & Prejudice
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her,Pride & Prejudice
"marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe",Pride & Prejudice
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new,Pride & Prejudice
"clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of",Pride & Prejudice
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they,Pride & Prejudice
took place.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of",Pride & Prejudice
"the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for",Pride & Prejudice
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the,Pride & Prejudice
"proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its",Pride & Prejudice
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the,Pride & Prejudice
spot.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were,Pride & Prejudice
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;,Pride & Prejudice
"but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's",Pride & Prejudice
"frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear",Pride & Prejudice
"of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,",Pride & Prejudice
there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been,Pride & Prejudice
"concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other",Pride & Prejudice
"objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the",Pride & Prejudice
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The,Pride & Prejudice
"wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his",Pride & Prejudice
"feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a",Pride & Prejudice
"blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she",Pride & Prejudice
"hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no",Pride & Prejudice
"longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there",Pride & Prejudice
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that,Pride & Prejudice
"she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they",Pride & Prejudice
should meet.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the",Pride & Prejudice
"proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now",Pride & Prejudice
"have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she",Pride & Prejudice
"doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,",Pride & Prejudice
there must be a triumph.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in",Pride & Prejudice
"disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and",Pride & Prejudice
"temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It",Pride & Prejudice
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease,Pride & Prejudice
"and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;",Pride & Prejudice
"and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she",Pride & Prejudice
must have received benefit of greater importance.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what,Pride & Prejudice
"connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and",Pride & Prejudice
"precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their",Pride & Prejudice
family.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,",Pride & Prejudice
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could,Pride & Prejudice
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions,Pride & Prejudice
"were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's,Pride & Prejudice
"acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to",Pride & Prejudice
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties,Pride & Prejudice
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal,Pride & Prejudice
purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved,Pride & Prejudice
on quitting the militia.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""It was greatly my wish that he should do so,"" he added, ""as soon as",Pride & Prejudice
"his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in",Pride & Prejudice
"considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on",Pride & Prejudice
his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into,Pride & Prejudice
"the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who",Pride & Prejudice
are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an,Pride & Prejudice
"ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It",Pride & Prejudice
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He,Pride & Prejudice
"promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each",Pride & Prejudice
"have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have",Pride & Prejudice
"written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,",Pride & Prejudice
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham,Pride & Prejudice
"in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I",Pride & Prejudice
have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying,Pride & Prejudice
"similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin",Pride & Prejudice
a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I,Pride & Prejudice
"hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,",Pride & Prejudice
"and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,",Pride & Prejudice
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
"Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she",Pride & Prejudice
"leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal,Pride & Prejudice
from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet,Pride & Prejudice
"was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,",Pride & Prejudice
"just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,",Pride & Prejudice
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in,Pride & Prejudice
"Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a",Pride & Prejudice
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted,Pride & Prejudice
"with everybody, and had so many favourites.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,"" said she, ""it will be quite shocking",Pride & Prejudice
"to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice

mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show,Pride & Prejudice
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the,Pride & Prejudice
"North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent",Pride & Prejudice
"his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as",Pride & Prejudice
"the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was",Pride & Prejudice

Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her,Pride & Prejudice
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to,Pride & Prejudice
"meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their",Pride & Prejudice
"arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,",Pride & Prejudice
"who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she",Pride & Prejudice
"been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister",Pride & Prejudice
must endure.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive,Pride & Prejudice
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to,Pride & Prejudice
"the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,",Pride & Prejudice
"anxious, uneasy.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and",Pride & Prejudice
"she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and",Pride & Prejudice
"welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,",Pride & Prejudice
"to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an",Pride & Prejudice
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite",Pride & Prejudice
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely,Pride & Prejudice
"opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was",Pride & Prejudice
"enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet",Pride & Prejudice
"was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,",Pride & Prejudice
"and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their",Pride & Prejudice
"congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly",Pride & Prejudice
"round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and",Pride & Prejudice
"observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been",Pride & Prejudice
there.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners",Pride & Prejudice
"were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been",Pride & Prejudice
"exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he",Pride & Prejudice
"claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had",Pride & Prejudice
"not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,",Pride & Prejudice
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence,Pride & Prejudice
"of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the",Pride & Prejudice
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither,Pride & Prejudice
"of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,",Pride & Prejudice
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her,Pride & Prejudice
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the,Pride & Prejudice
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led,Pride & Prejudice
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for,Pride & Prejudice
the world.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Only think of its being three months,"" she cried, ""since I went away;",Pride & Prejudice
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things,Pride & Prejudice
"enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure",Pride & Prejudice
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I,Pride & Prejudice
"thought it would be very good fun if I was.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked,Pride & Prejudice
"expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of",Pride & Prejudice
"which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, ""Oh! mamma, do the",Pride & Prejudice
people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;,Pride & Prejudice
"and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he",Pride & Prejudice
"should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took",Pride & Prejudice
"off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that",Pride & Prejudice
"he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;",Pride & Prejudice
"and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to",Pride & Prejudice
"the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with",Pride & Prejudice
"anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say",Pride & Prejudice
"to her eldest sister, ""Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go",Pride & Prejudice
"lower, because I am a married woman.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,Pride & Prejudice
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good,Pride & Prejudice
"spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and",Pride & Prejudice
"all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called ""Mrs. Wickham""",Pride & Prejudice
"by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her",Pride & Prejudice
"ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Well, mamma,"" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast",Pride & Prejudice
"room, ""and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I",Pride & Prejudice
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half,Pride & Prejudice
my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get,Pride & Prejudice
"husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't",Pride & Prejudice

"""Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all",Pride & Prejudice

"""I should like it beyond anything!"" said her mother.",Pride & Prejudice

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham,Pride & Prejudice
"had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join",Pride & Prejudice
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and,Pride & Prejudice
"she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and",Pride & Prejudice
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to,Pride & Prejudice
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did,Pride & Prejudice
"think, than such as did not.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected,Pride & Prejudice
to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her,Pride & Prejudice
"present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that",Pride & Prejudice
"their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather",Pride & Prejudice
"than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring",Pride & Prejudice
"for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain",Pride & Prejudice
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and,Pride & Prejudice
"if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity",Pride & Prejudice
of having a companion.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""No really,"" replied Elizabeth; ""I think there cannot be too little said",Pride & Prejudice
"on the subject.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were",Pride & Prejudice
"married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in",Pride & Prejudice
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven,Pride & Prejudice
o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others,Pride & Prejudice
"were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in",Pride & Prejudice
"such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to",Pride & Prejudice
"put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was",Pride & Prejudice
"my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as",Pride & Prejudice
"if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in",Pride & Prejudice
"ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed",Pride & Prejudice
"to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never",Pride & Prejudice
"be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt",Pride & Prejudice
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe,Pride & Prejudice
"me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a",Pride & Prejudice
"fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was",Pride & Prejudice
"rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so",Pride & Prejudice
"just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon",Pride & Prejudice
"business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once",Pride & Prejudice
"they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I",Pride & Prejudice
"did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we",Pride & Prejudice
"were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he",Pride & Prejudice
"came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,",Pride & Prejudice
"I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the",Pride & Prejudice
"wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Mr. Darcy!"" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious",Pride & Prejudice

"them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""If it was to be secret,"" said Jane, ""say not another word on the",Pride & Prejudice
"subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! certainly,"" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; ""we will",Pride & Prejudice

it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at,Pride & Prejudice

"where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.",Pride & Prejudice
"Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her",Pride & Prejudice
"brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as",Pride & Prejudice
"placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She",Pride & Prejudice
"could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,",Pride & Prejudice
"wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what",Pride & Prejudice
"Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been",Pride & Prejudice
intended.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You may readily comprehend,"" she added, ""what my curiosity must be",Pride & Prejudice

"a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,",Pride & Prejudice

"than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to",Pride & Prejudice
"be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to",Pride & Prejudice

"""On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most",Pride & Prejudice
"unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several",Pride & Prejudice
hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so,Pride & Prejudice
dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.,Pride & Prejudice
"Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,",Pride & Prejudice
"and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,",Pride & Prejudice
"Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day",Pride & Prejudice
"after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for",Pride & Prejudice
them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to,Pride & Prejudice
himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to,Pride & Prejudice
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide,Pride & Prejudice
"in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and",Pride & Prejudice
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private,Pride & Prejudice
actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He,Pride & Prejudice
"called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy",Pride & Prejudice
an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_,Pride & Prejudice
"motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days",Pride & Prejudice
"in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to",Pride & Prejudice
"direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness",Pride & Prejudice
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago",Pride & Prejudice
"governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause",Pride & Prejudice
"of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large",Pride & Prejudice
"house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting",Pride & Prejudice
"lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with",Pride & Prejudice
Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to,Pride & Prejudice
town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he,Pride & Prejudice
"wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and",Pride & Prejudice
"corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had",Pride & Prejudice
"she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up",Pride & Prejudice
"their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the",Pride & Prejudice
"wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and",Pride & Prejudice
"afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he",Pride & Prejudice
"acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful",Pride & Prejudice
"situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed",Pride & Prejudice
"on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But",Pride & Prejudice
he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared,Pride & Prejudice
for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear,Pride & Prejudice
of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or,Pride & Prejudice
"other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,",Pride & Prejudice
"it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,",Pride & Prejudice
"in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never",Pride & Prejudice
"been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,",Pride & Prejudice
"on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and",Pride & Prejudice
scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her,Pride & Prejudice
own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as,Pride & Prejudice
"to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He",Pride & Prejudice
"must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have",Pride & Prejudice
nothing to live on.,Pride & Prejudice

"""Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though",Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able",Pride & Prejudice
"to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by",Pride & Prejudice
"marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still",Pride & Prejudice

"weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and",Pride & Prejudice
smiled and shook her head by turns.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"" (for Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Phillips first brought her the news). ""Well, so much the better. Not",Pride & Prejudice
"that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am",Pride & Prejudice
"sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome",Pride & Prejudice
"to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?",Pride & Prejudice
"But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to",Pride & Prejudice
"mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You may depend on it,"" replied the other, ""for Mrs. Nicholls was in",Pride & Prejudice

"Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present",Pride & Prejudice

"any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that",Pride & Prejudice
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect,Pride & Prejudice
"me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes",Pride & Prejudice
alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of,Pride & Prejudice
"_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in,Pride & Prejudice
"Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no",Pride & Prejudice
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial,Pride & Prejudice
"to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming",Pride & Prejudice
"there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come",Pride & Prejudice
without it.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yet it is hard,"" she sometimes thought, ""that this poor man cannot",Pride & Prejudice
"come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this",Pride & Prejudice
"speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her",Pride & Prejudice
"feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily",Pride & Prejudice
"perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,",Pride & Prejudice
"more unequal, than she had often seen them.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,",Pride & Prejudice
"about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.",Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention,Pride & Prejudice
"would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to",Pride & Prejudice
Netherfield.,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"""Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait",Pride & Prejudice
"on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I",Pride & Prejudice

"make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for",Pride & Prejudice
"him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her",Pride & Prejudice

"neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before",Pride & Prejudice
"_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,"" said Jane to her sister. ""It",Pride & Prejudice
"would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can",Pride & Prejudice

"says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I wish I could say anything to comfort you,"" replied Elizabeth; ""but it",Pride & Prejudice

"of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have",Pride & Prejudice
"always so much.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,",Pride & Prejudice
"contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety",Pride & Prejudice
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted,Pride & Prejudice
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;,Pride & Prejudice
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his,Pride & Prejudice
"arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,",Pride & Prejudice
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely,Pride & Prejudice
"kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went",Pride & Prejudice
"to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down",Pride & Prejudice
again by her sister.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""There is a gentleman with him, mamma,"" said Kitty; ""who can it be?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not",Pride & Prejudice

"Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must",Pride & Prejudice
"say that I hate the very sight of him.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little,Pride & Prejudice
"of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness",Pride & Prejudice
"which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time",Pride & Prejudice
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable,Pride & Prejudice
"enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their",Pride & Prejudice
"mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be",Pride & Prejudice
"civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either",Pride & Prejudice
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be,Pride & Prejudice
"suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.",Pride & Prejudice
"To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,",Pride & Prejudice
and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive,Pride & Prejudice
"information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted",Pride & Prejudice
"for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an",Pride & Prejudice
"interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as",Pride & Prejudice
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his,Pride & Prejudice
"coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,",Pride & Prejudice
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered,Pride & Prejudice
behaviour in Derbyshire.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a",Pride & Prejudice
"minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to",Pride & Prejudice
"her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and",Pride & Prejudice
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Let me first see how he behaves,"" said she; ""it will then be early",Pride & Prejudice
"enough for expectation.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to",Pride & Prejudice
"lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of",Pride & Prejudice
her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little,Pride & Prejudice
"paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the",Pride & Prejudice
"gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with",Pride & Prejudice
"tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any",Pride & Prejudice
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down",Pride & Prejudice
"again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She",Pride & Prejudice
"had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,",Pride & Prejudice
"she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as",Pride & Prejudice
"she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's",Pride & Prejudice
"presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but",Pride & Prejudice
"not an improbable, conjecture.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period",Pride & Prejudice
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,",Pride & Prejudice
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of,Pride & Prejudice
her curtsey and address to his friend.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter",Pride & Prejudice
"the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,",Pride & Prejudice
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill,Pride & Prejudice
applied.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question",Pride & Prejudice
"which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He",Pride & Prejudice
was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but,Pride & Prejudice
"it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,",Pride & Prejudice
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without,Pride & Prejudice
"bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist",Pride & Prejudice
"the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often",Pride & Prejudice
"found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but",Pride & Prejudice
"the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when",Pride & Prejudice
"they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry",Pride & Prejudice
with herself for being so.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Could I expect it to be otherwise!"" said she. ""Yet why did he come?""",Pride & Prejudice

"She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.",Pride & Prejudice

"consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It",Pride & Prejudice
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in,Pride & Prejudice
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table,Pride & Prejudice
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little,Pride & Prejudice

"good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many",Pride & Prejudice
"expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Next time you call,"" said she, ""I hope we shall be more lucky.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would",Pride & Prejudice
"give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Can you come to-morrow?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was",Pride & Prejudice
accepted with alacrity.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them",Pride & Prejudice
"dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing",Pride & Prejudice
"gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is",Pride & Prejudice
"come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss",Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss",Pride & Prejudice
"Lizzy's hair.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""We will be down as soon as we can,"" said Jane; ""but I dare say Kitty is",Pride & Prejudice
"forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!",Pride & Prejudice
"Where is your sash, my dear?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down",Pride & Prejudice
without one of her sisters.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the,Pride & Prejudice
"evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his",Pride & Prejudice
"custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of",Pride & Prejudice
"the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any",Pride & Prejudice
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last,Pride & Prejudice
"Kitty did, she very innocently said, ""What is the matter mamma? What do",Pride & Prejudice
"you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you."" She then sat still",Pride & Prejudice
"five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she",Pride & Prejudice
"suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, ""Come here, my love, I want to",Pride & Prejudice
"speak to you,"" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look",Pride & Prejudice
"at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her",Pride & Prejudice
"entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
Bennet half-opened the door and called out:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth was forced to go.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"" said her mother, as",Pride & Prejudice
"soon as she was in the hall. ""Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in",Pride & Prejudice
"my dressing-room.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained",Pride & Prejudice
"quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned",Pride & Prejudice
into the drawing-room.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every,Pride & Prejudice
"thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His",Pride & Prejudice
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their,Pride & Prejudice
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the,Pride & Prejudice
"mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command",Pride & Prejudice
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went,Pride & Prejudice
"away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.",Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed",Pride & Prejudice
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in,Pride & Prejudice
"the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy",Pride & Prejudice
"returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably",Pride & Prejudice
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's,Pride & Prejudice
concurrence.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent,Pride & Prejudice
"the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more",Pride & Prejudice
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption,Pride & Prejudice
"or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into",Pride & Prejudice
"silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the",Pride & Prejudice
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;,Pride & Prejudice
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get,Pride & Prejudice
"every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter",Pride & Prejudice
"to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;",Pride & Prejudice
"for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be",Pride & Prejudice
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she",Pride & Prejudice
"saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother",Pride & Prejudice
"had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her",Pride & Prejudice
"sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in",Pride & Prejudice
"earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of",Pride & Prejudice
"both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would",Pride & Prejudice
have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she,Pride & Prejudice
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as",Pride & Prejudice
"well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few",Pride & Prejudice
"words to her sister, ran out of the room.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give",Pride & Prejudice
"pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest",Pride & Prejudice
"emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""'Tis too much!"" she added, ""by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!",Pride & Prejudice
"why is not everybody as happy?""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,",Pride & Prejudice
"a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of",Pride & Prejudice
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not,Pride & Prejudice
"allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be",Pride & Prejudice
said for the present.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I must go instantly to my mother;"" she cried. ""I would not on any",Pride & Prejudice
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it,Pride & Prejudice
"from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to",Pride & Prejudice
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear,Pride & Prejudice
"family! how shall I bear so much happiness!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the",Pride & Prejudice
"card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease",Pride & Prejudice
"with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many",Pride & Prejudice
previous months of suspense and vexation.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""And this,"" said she, ""is the end of all his friend's anxious",Pride & Prejudice
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the,Pride & Prejudice
"happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her",Pride & Prejudice
father had been short and to the purpose.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Where is your sister?"" said he hastily, as he opened the door.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes",Pride & Prejudice
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed,Pride & Prejudice
her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with,Pride & Prejudice
"great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen",Pride & Prejudice
"to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;",Pride & Prejudice
"and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his",Pride & Prejudice
"expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for",Pride & Prejudice
"basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of",Pride & Prejudice
"Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and",Pride & Prejudice
himself.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of,Pride & Prejudice
"Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as",Pride & Prejudice
"made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped",Pride & Prejudice
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or,Pride & Prejudice
"speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,",Pride & Prejudice
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when,Pride & Prejudice
"Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed",Pride & Prejudice
how really happy he was.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their",Pride & Prejudice
"visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he",Pride & Prejudice
"turned to his daughter, and said:",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his",Pride & Prejudice
goodness.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""You are a good girl;"" he replied, ""and I have great pleasure in",Pride & Prejudice
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your,Pride & Prejudice
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are,Pride & Prejudice
"each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so",Pride & Prejudice
"easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will",Pride & Prejudice
"always exceed your income.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be",Pride & Prejudice
"unpardonable in me.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,"" cried his wife, ""what are you",Pride & Prejudice
"talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely",Pride & Prejudice
"more."" Then addressing her daughter, ""Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so",Pride & Prejudice
happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it,Pride & Prejudice
"would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not",Pride & Prejudice
"be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when",Pride & Prejudice
"he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was",Pride & Prejudice
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that,Pride & Prejudice
"ever was seen!""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her",Pride & Prejudice
"favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger",Pride & Prejudice
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness,Pride & Prejudice
which she might in future be able to dispense.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty,Pride & Prejudice
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;",Pride & Prejudice
"coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after",Pride & Prejudice
"supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough",Pride & Prejudice
"detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself",Pride & Prejudice
obliged to accept.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for,Pride & Prejudice
"while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;",Pride & Prejudice
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours,Pride & Prejudice
"of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he",Pride & Prejudice
"always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of",Pride & Prejudice
"her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of",Pride & Prejudice
relief.,Pride & Prejudice

,Pride & Prejudice
"One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been",Pride & Prejudice
"formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the",Pride & Prejudice
"dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the",Pride & Prejudice
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up,Pride & Prejudice
"the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the",Pride & Prejudice
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses,Pride & Prejudice
"were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who",Pride & Prejudice
"preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that",Pride & Prejudice
"somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid",Pride & Prejudice
"the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the",Pride & Prejudice
"shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three",Pride & Prejudice
"continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown",Pride & Prejudice
open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their,Pride & Prejudice
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.,Pride & Prejudice
"Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even",Pride & Prejudice
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no",Pride & Prejudice
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the,Pride & Prejudice

introduction had been made.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such",Pride & Prejudice
"high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting",Pride & Prejudice
"for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,",Pride & Prejudice

"""I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your",Pride & Prejudice

"Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some",Pride & Prejudice

The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw,Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many",Pride & Prejudice
"hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it",Pride & Prejudice
"appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,",Pride & Prejudice
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.,Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report",Pride & Prejudice
"of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;",Pride & Prejudice
"till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,",Pride & Prejudice
"and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the",Pride & Prejudice
"expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply",Pride & Prejudice
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her,Pride & Prejudice

"at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the",Pride & Prejudice

"only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked",Pride & Prejudice
forward to as possible at some future time.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help",Pride & Prejudice
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting,Pride & Prejudice
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to,Pride & Prejudice
"prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate",Pride & Prejudice
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar,Pride & Prejudice
"representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared",Pride & Prejudice
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his,Pride & Prejudice
"aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose",Pride & Prejudice
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it,Pride & Prejudice
"was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,",Pride & Prejudice
"whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would",Pride & Prejudice
"address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would",Pride & Prejudice
"probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak",Pride & Prejudice
"and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often",Pride & Prejudice
"seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might",Pride & Prejudice
"settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity",Pride & Prejudice
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady,Pride & Prejudice

"be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and",Pride & Prejudice
"aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as",Pride & Prejudice
follows:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,",Pride & Prejudice
"for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the",Pride & Prejudice
"truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.",Pride & Prejudice
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your,Pride & Prejudice
"fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the",Pride & Prejudice
"subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you",Pride & Prejudice
"cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a",Pride & Prejudice
"great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,",Pride & Prejudice
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your,Pride & Prejudice
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I,Pride & Prejudice
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so,Pride & Prejudice
"before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she",Pride & Prejudice
"only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that",Pride & Prejudice
he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.,Pride & Prejudice
"Yours, etc.""",Pride & Prejudice

Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still,Pride & Prejudice
"different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply",Pride & Prejudice
to his last.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""DEAR SIR,",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon",Pride & Prejudice
be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.,Pride & Prejudice
"But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yours sincerely, etc.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching",Pride & Prejudice
"marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even",Pride & Prejudice
"to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her",Pride & Prejudice
"former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was",Pride & Prejudice
"affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing",Pride & Prejudice
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,",Pride & Prejudice
was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were,Pride & Prejudice
"insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of",Pride & Prejudice
being loved by her sister.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations",Pride & Prejudice
"to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the",Pride & Prejudice
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this,Pride & Prejudice
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered,Pride & Prejudice
"so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that",Pride & Prejudice
"Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till",Pride & Prejudice
"the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend",Pride & Prejudice
"was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their",Pride & Prejudice
"meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she",Pride & Prejudice
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of,Pride & Prejudice
"her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even",Pride & Prejudice
"listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away",Pride & Prejudice
"the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all",Pride & Prejudice
"meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did",Pride & Prejudice
"shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his",Pride & Prejudice
"forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in",Pride & Prejudice
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good,Pride & Prejudice
"humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.",Pride & Prejudice
"Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all",Pride & Prejudice
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield,Pride & Prejudice
"him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep",Pride & Prejudice
"him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse",Pride & Prejudice
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising,Pride & Prejudice
"from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it",Pride & Prejudice
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to,Pride & Prejudice
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing,Pride & Prejudice

Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got,Pride & Prejudice
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride,Pride & Prejudice
"she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may",Pride & Prejudice
"be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the",Pride & Prejudice
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many,Pride & Prejudice
"of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,",Pride & Prejudice
"amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it",Pride & Prejudice
"was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity",Pride & Prejudice
"in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and",Pride & Prejudice
invariably silly.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her,Pride & Prejudice
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in,Pride & Prejudice
"going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near,Pride & Prejudice
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to,Pride & Prejudice
"_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his",Pride & Prejudice
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county,Pride & Prejudice
"to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source",Pride & Prejudice
"of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with",Pride & Prejudice
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally,Pride & Prejudice
"known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a",Pride & Prejudice
"temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,",Pride & Prejudice
"she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less",Pride & Prejudice
"ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's",Pride & Prejudice
"society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham",Pride & Prejudice
"frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of",Pride & Prejudice
"balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily,Pride & Prejudice
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite,Pride & Prejudice
"unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but",Pride & Prejudice
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no,Pride & Prejudice
"longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,",Pride & Prejudice
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without,Pride & Prejudice
much reluctance.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from",Pride & Prejudice
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that,Pride & Prejudice
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude,Pride & Prejudice
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every,Pride & Prejudice
"thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on",Pride & Prejudice
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received,Pride & Prejudice
"from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,",Pride & Prejudice
"if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this",Pride & Prejudice
effect:,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""MY DEAR LIZZY,",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear",Pride & Prejudice
"Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so",Pride & Prejudice
"rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.",Pride & Prejudice
"I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not",Pride & Prejudice
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.,Pride & Prejudice
"Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,",Pride & Prejudice
"do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"""Yours, etc.""",Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in",Pride & Prejudice
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.,Pride & Prejudice
"Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice",Pride & Prejudice
"of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she",Pride & Prejudice
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an,Pride & Prejudice
"income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in",Pride & Prejudice
"their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to",Pride & Prejudice
"their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or",Pride & Prejudice
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance,Pride & Prejudice
"towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the",Pride & Prejudice
"restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the",Pride & Prejudice
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap,Pride & Prejudice
"situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for",Pride & Prejudice
her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and,Pride & Prejudice
"in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to",Pride & Prejudice
reputation which her marriage had given her.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for",Pride & Prejudice
"Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was",Pride & Prejudice
"occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself",Pride & Prejudice
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently,Pride & Prejudice
"staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he",Pride & Prejudice
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she,Pride & Prejudice
"thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she",Pride & Prejudice
"dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as",Pride & Prejudice
"attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility",Pride & Prejudice
to Elizabeth.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters,Pride & Prejudice
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each,Pride & Prejudice
other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion,Pride & Prejudice
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with,Pride & Prejudice
"an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of",Pride & Prejudice
"talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect",Pride & Prejudice
"which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open",Pride & Prejudice
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen,Pride & Prejudice
"in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that",Pride & Prejudice
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not,Pride & Prejudice
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;,Pride & Prejudice
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in,Pride & Prejudice
"her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him",Pride & Prejudice
"language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time",Pride & Prejudice
"all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,",Pride & Prejudice
"he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;",Pride & Prejudice
"and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her",Pride & Prejudice
"resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity",Pride & Prejudice
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait,Pride & Prejudice
"on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had",Pride & Prejudice
"received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the",Pride & Prejudice
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.,Pride & Prejudice
,Pride & Prejudice
"With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.",Pride & Prejudice
"Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever",Pride & Prejudice
"sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing",Pride & Prejudice
"her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.",Pride & Prejudice
