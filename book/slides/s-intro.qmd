- 🖼️ Examples: texts, images, audio, video
- 📈 Often large-scale datasets


---

## DH Processing 

- 🧮 Computational methods and tools
- 📊 Data analysis and modeling
- 🤖 Machine learning and AI applications


---

## DH Presentation 

- 📊 Visualizations
- 🗄️ Digital archives
- 🖱️ Interactive platforms
- 🗃️ Databases

## Digital Humanities vs Traditional Humanities {.smaller} 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Traditional Humanities:

- 🔎 Limited by human reading capacity
- 🧑‍🏫 Often individual research
- 📚 Primarily books and articles
- 🖋️ Close reading and interpretation
- 🏛️ Focus on canonical works
- 🗂️ Manual data collection and analysis
- 🌐 Geographically limited research scope
- 🕰️ Time-intensive archival research
- 📊 Limited quantitative analysis
- 🎭 Emphasis on qualitative methods
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Digital Humanities:

- 📊 Handles large datasets and corpora
- 👥 Often team-based, interdisciplinary projects
- 🖥️ Diverse digital outputs (visualizations, databases, etc.)
- 🔍 Distant reading and pattern recognition
- 📜 Inclusion of non-canonical texts and artifacts
- 🤖 Automated data collection and processing
- 🌍 Global reach through digital archives
- ⚡ Rapid processing of vast information
- 📈 Advanced statistical and computational analysis
- 🔀 Integration of quantitative and qualitative methods

## Reflection 

### 💡 Does humanities need computational methods?
### 🧑 Are we losing the "human" in digital humanities?
### ⚖️ How might DH methods transform your area of study?

Discuss with a partner, then share with the class.
