    "text": "🚀 Important Pep Talk!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💪 Setting the Right Mindset\n\n\n\nRemember these key points while you embark on your DH journey:\n\n\n\nEmbrace the Learning Curve\n\nLearning digital tools and methods is like learning a new language—it takes time and practice.\nDon’t be discouraged by initial difficulties; everyone faces challenges when starting out.\nCelebrate small victories and progress along the way.\n\n\n\nFrustration is Part of Growth\n\nFeeling frustrated? Congratulations! It means you’re pushing your boundaries and learning.\nHadley Wickham (Father of modern R syntax) once said: “Everyone gets frustrated… I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming.”\nTake breaks when needed, but don’t give up. Return with fresh eyes and renewed determination.\n\n\n\nCultivate Curiosity\n\nApproach new concepts with an open and inquisitive mind.\nAsk questions, explore beyond the course material, and let your curiosity drive your learning.\nDigital humanities is a field of endless possibilities—embrace the excitement of discovery.\n\n\n\nBuild Resilience\n\nExpect challenges and setbacks—they’re not roadblocks, but opportunities to problem-solve.\nDevelop a growth mindset: view difficulties as chances to improve, not as personal shortcomings.\nRemember: every expert was once a beginner. Persistence is key to mastery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you put your heart to it. Learning new digital skills may seem daunting at first, but with patience, persistence, and the right mindset, you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve. Don’t hesitate to reach out for help when you need it—we’re all in this learning journey together!"

    "text": "This is the textbook for the course Introduction to Digital Humanities taught by Meng Liu, at the School of English and International Studies, Beijing Foreign Studies University.\nIntroduction to Digital Humanities explores the intersection of humanities scholarship and digital methodologies. Students will learn how computational techniques can enhance humanities research, covering key concepts in digital humanities, modern R programming, and various analytical methods including quantitative text analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis. Through hands-on application of digital tools to humanities data, students will develop both technical skills and critical thinking abilities. The course progresses from foundational programming to advanced analytical techniques, concluding with discussions on ethics and AI in humanities scholarship. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a versatile toolkit for innovative, data-driven humanities research, suitable for those seeking to expand their methodological approach to cultural studies.\nThe content of the book is updated on a regular basis as the course progresses.",

    "text": "2 Online Help\nData science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and Posit Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\nIf you use Mastodon or Twitter/X, post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\nChatGPT is generally relatively okay with R questions, but it may hallucinate responses—it sometimes imagine packages that don’t exist and then give you answers with them. Think of it as glorified autocomplete. I’d encourage you to read the first few paragraphs here about a few important things to keep in mind when using ChatGPT, though.\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”). Also, since most of your R work will deal with {ggplot2}, it’s often easier to just search for that instead of the letter “r” (e.g. “ggplot scatterplot”).",

    "section": "3 Installation Guide",
    "text": "3 Installation Guide\n\n3.1 Install R\nFirst you need to install R itself (the engine).\n\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows: \n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 4.4.1) and download it.\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it. \n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\n3.2 Install RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it: \nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\n3.3 Install tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter. \nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including {ggplot2}) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed. \nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\n3.4 Install tinytex (Optional, this is for rendering PDF files)\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced “lay-tek” or “lah-tex”; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the “ch” sound in “Bach”, but most people just say it as “k”—saying “layteks” is frowned on for whatever reason).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it’s a huge program—the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB! To make life easier, there’s an R package named {tinytex} that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere’s how to install {tinytex} so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install {tinytex} like you did above with {tidyverse}. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nThe end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.\n\nCredit: this installation guide was adpated from the guide by Dr Andrew Heiss at Georgia State University.",
