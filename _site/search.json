Students will learn how computational techniques can enhance humanities research, covering key concepts in digital humanities, modern R programming, and various analytical methods including quantitative text analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and social network analysis. Through hands-on application of digital tools to humanities data, students will develop both technical skills and critical thinking abilities. The course progresses from foundational programming to advanced analytical techniques, concluding with discussions on ethics and AI in humanities scholarship. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a versatile toolkit for innovative, data-driven humanities research, suitable for those seeking to expand their methodological approach to cultural studies.\nThe content of the book is updated on a regular basis as the course progresses.",
