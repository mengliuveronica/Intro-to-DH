It’s a fundamental concept in the tidyverse that greatly enhances code readability and workflow. Here’s how it works:\n\nFunction chaining: The pipe takes the output of one function and passes it as the first argument to the next function. This allows us to chain multiple operations together in a logical sequence.\nLeft-to-right reading: Instead of nesting functions within each other, which can be hard to read, the pipe allows us to read our code from left to right, much like we read English.\nImproved readability: By using the pipe, we can break down complex operations into a series of smaller, more manageable steps.\n\nFor example, let’s compare these two equivalent operations:\nWithout pipe:\n\nfilter(books, year &gt; 1900)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  title                  author      year genre         pages\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1984                   Orwell      1949 Dystopian       328\n2 The Great Gatsby       Fitzgerald  1925 Modernist       180\n3 To Kill a Mockingbird  Lee         1960 Coming-of-age   281\n4 The Catcher in the Rye Salinger    1951 Coming-of-age   234\n\n\nWith pipe:\n\nbooks %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 1900)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  title                  author      year genre         pages\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1984                   Orwell      1949 Dystopian       328\n2 The Great Gatsby       Fitzgerald  1925 Modernist       180\n3 To Kill a Mockingbird  Lee         1960 Coming-of-age   281\n4 The Catcher in the Rye Salinger    1951 Coming-of-age   234\n\n\nThe piped version can be read as “Take the books data, then filter it to keep only books published after 1900”.\nFor more complex operations, the benefits become even clearer, which we will see in a moment.",

    "text": "2.7 Chaining Multiple Actions\nOne of the key advantages of Tidyverse is the ability to chain multiple actions together using the pipe operator (%&gt;%). Let’s compare how we can perform a series of data manipulations using both Tidyverse and Base R.\nLet’s say we want to: 1. Filter books published after 1900 2. Select only the title, author, and year columns 3. Sort the results by year 4. Get the first 3 entries\n\n2.7.1 Tidyverse Approach\n\nbooks %&gt;%\nfilter(year &gt; 1900) %&gt;%\nselect(title, author, year) %&gt;%\narrange(year) %&gt;%\nhead(3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  title                  author      year\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 The Great Gatsby       Fitzgerald  1925\n2 1984                   Orwell      1949\n3 The Catcher in the Rye Salinger    1951\n\n\nIn this Tidyverse approach, we can read the code from left to right, following the logical flow of operations. Each step is clearly defined, and the pipe operator (%&gt;%) passes the result of each operation to the next.\n\n2.7.2 Base R Approach\n\n# Filter books published after 1900\nfiltered_books &lt;- books[books$year &gt; 1900, ]\n# Select only title, author, and year columns\nselected_books &lt;- filtered_books[, c(\"title\", \"author\", \"year\")]\n# Sort by year\nsorted_books &lt;- selected_books[order(selected_books$year), ]\n# Get the first 3 entries\nresult &lt;- head(sorted_books, 3)\n# View the result\nresult\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  title                  author      year\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 The Great Gatsby       Fitzgerald  1925\n2 1984                   Orwell      1949\n3 The Catcher in the Rye Salinger    1951\n\n\nIn the Base R approach, we need to create intermediate variables at each step. The code reads from top to bottom, with each line representing a separate operation.",

    "text": "4.1 Hands-On Coding 💻\nLet’s explore our slot machine results with some exercises. Remember to use tidyverse functions like filter(), summarise(), group_by(), and ggplot().\n\n4.1.1 Exercise 1: Summarize the Results\nCalculate the total number of plays, number of wins, and the win percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse summarise() with n(), sum() functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresults %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_plays = _(),\n    wins = _(win),\n    win_percentage = wins/ _ *100\n)\n\nresults %&gt;%summarise(n())\n\n\n\n\nresults %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_plays = n(),\n    wins = sum(win),\n    win_percentage = wins / total_plays * 100\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  total_plays  wins win_percentage\n        &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         100     1              1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn() vs. nrow()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn() is a dplyr function:\n\n\nIt’s designed to work seamlessly within dplyr verbs like summarise(), mutate(), and filter().\nIt’s particularly useful when working with grouped data.\n\n\nnrow() is a base R function:\n\n\nIt works on data frames and matrices, but not directly within dplyr pipelines.\nIt doesn’t automatically respect grouping in dplyr operations.\n\n\nBehavior with grouped data:\n\n\nn() will give you the count for each group when used with group_by().\nnrow() will always return the total number of rows in the entire data frame.\n\n\nSyntax in dplyr operations:\n\n\nn() can be used directly: summarise(count = n())\nnrow() typically needs to be wrapped: summarise(count = nrow(.))\n\n\nPerformance:\n\n\nn() is optimized for dplyr operations and can be faster in some cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Exercise 2: Find Winning Combinations\nCreate a new data frame showing only the winning plays and their symbol combinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse filter() to select winning plays, then select() to choose the columns you want to display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwinning_plays &lt;- results %&gt;%\n  filter(_ == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  select(play, symbol1, symbol2, symbol3)\n\nprint(winning_plays)\n\n\n\n\nwinning_plays &lt;- results %&gt;%\n  filter(win == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  select(play, symbol1, symbol2, symbol3)\nprint(winning_plays)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n   play symbol1 symbol2 symbol3\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  \n1    28 🍋      🍋      🍋     \n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Exercise 3: Visualize Symbol Distribution\nCreate a bar plot showing the distribution of symbols in the first reel (symbol1 column).\nEmojis often can’t be rendered directly in plots. While there are packages like emojifont or ggtext that can handle emoji rendering, for simplicity, we’ll use a text representation of the symbols.\n\nresults &lt;- results %&gt;%\n  mutate(symbol1_text = case_when(\n    symbol1 == \"🍒\" ~ \"Cherry\",\n    symbol1 == \"🍋\" ~ \"Lemon\",\n    symbol1 == \"🍊\" ~ \"Orange\",\n    symbol1 == \"🍇\" ~ \"Grapes\",\n    symbol1 == \"🔔\" ~ \"Bell\",\n    symbol1 == \"💎\" ~ \"Diamond\"\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1/2\n\n\n\n\n\nUse ggplot() with geom_bar() to create a bar chart of symbol1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2/2\n\n\n\n\n\nIn aes(), map symbol1 to both x and fill for a colored bar chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(results, aes(x = _, fill = _)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Symbols in First Reel\", x = \"Symbol\", y = \"Count\") \n\n\n\nA Simple Plot\n\nggplot(results, aes(x = symbol1_text, fill = symbol1_text)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Symbols in First Reel\", x = \"Symbol\", y = \"Count\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Customized Plot\nA strength of ggplot2 is that it allows various cutomizations of the plot. Below is an example where we manually set the fill colors of the bar plot. You can also check out packages such as RColorBrewer for presets of color pallettes. ggplot2 also has preset themes that you can use to immediately give the plot a cleaner or more professional look (e.g., the theme_minimal() used in the following example).\n\n# Define a custom color palette\nsymbol_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"Cherry\" = \"#D2042D\",  # Red\n  \"Lemon\" = \"#FFF700\",   # Yellow\n  \"Orange\" = \"#FFA500\",  # Orange\n  \"Grapes\" = \"#6F2DA8\",  # Purple\n  \"Bell\" = \"#FFD700\",    # Gold\n  \"Diamond\" = \"#B9F2FF\"  # Light Blue\n)\n\nggplot(results, aes(x = symbol1_text, fill = symbol1_text)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = symbol_colors) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Symbols in First Reel\", x = \"Symbol\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  # Remove legend as it's redundant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!

    "text": "3.1 Key Concepts of Functions in R\n\nPurpose: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.\n\nStructure: A function typically has three parts:\n\n\nName: What you call the function (e.g., sum, mean, plot)\n\nArguments: Input values the function needs to do its job\n\nBody: The code that defines what the function does\n\nHere’s the generic structure of a function in R:\n\nname_of_function &lt;- function(argument1, argument2, ...) {\n  # Body of the function\n  # Perform operations using the arguments\n\n  return(result)  # Output of the function\n}\n\nIn this structure:\n\n\nname_of_function is where you specify the function’s name\n\nfunction() keyword defines it as a function\n\n(argument1, argument2, ...) are the inputs the function accepts\nThe code between { and } is the body of the function\n\nreturn() specifies what the function outputs\n\nNow, let’s look at a specific example:\n\ndouble_value &lt;- function(x) {\n  result &lt;- x * 2\n  return(result)\n}\n\nIn this example:\n\nThe function name is double_value\n\nIt has one argument: x\n\nThe body is the code between the curly braces { }\n\nThe return() statement specifies what the function outputs\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\ndoubled_value &lt;- double_value(5)\ndoubled_value\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\nInput and Output: Functions often take input (arguments) and return output (results).\nBuilt-in vs. Custom: R has many built-in functions, but you can also create your own. You can also set default values for the arguments so that the function can still run without input.\n\nSyntax: To use a function, type its name followed by parentheses containing any arguments:\nfunction_name(argument1, argument2, ...)\n\nDocumentation: You can learn about a function’s use and arguments with ?function_name in the console.\n\nRemember, functions are powerful tools that help you organize and streamline your code, making your analysis more efficient and readable.",

    "section": "\n3.2 Using Built-in Functions",
    "text": "3.2 Using Built-in Functions\nR comes with many built-in functions that you can use right away. These are like the basic tools that come in a starter toolkit. Let’s look at a few examples:\n\n# The round() function rounds numbers\nround(3.14159)\n\n[1] 3\n\n# The sum() function adds numbers together\nsum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n[1] 15\n\n# The length() function tells you how many items are in a list or vector\nlength(die)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nUsing a function is straightforward. You write the name of the function followed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you put the information (called “arguments”) that the function needs to do its job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments in R\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you notice the # … part in the above code chunk?\nIn R, the # symbol is used to create comments. Anything after a # on a line is ignored by R when running the code. Comments are useful for:\n\nExplaining what your code does\nTemporarily disabling code without deleting it\nOrganizing your script into sections\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Simulating Randomness: sample()\n\nTo simulate rolling a die, we need a function that can randomly select a number. The sample() function is perfect for this task. It’s like reaching into a bag and pulling out a random item.\n\n# Roll the die once\nsample(x = die, size = 1)\n\n[1] 5\n\n# Roll the die again\nsample(x = die, size = 1)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nIn this case, x = die tells the function what to choose from (our die object), and size = 1 says to pick one number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling With Replacement\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, sample() doesn’t put the number back in the “bag” after selecting it. For dice rolling, we want to allow the same number to be selected multiple times. Use replace = TRUE in the sample() function to achieve this.\n\n\n\n\n# Roll two dice\nsample(die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)\n\n[1] 3 4",

    "text": "4.1 Why Use Quarto?\n\n\nReproducibility: Quarto documents contain both code and narrative that make it easy to reproduce your analyses.\n\nProfessional Presentation: Create polished, professional-looking documents.\n\nFlexibility: Output to various formats like HTML, PDF, or slideshows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Reproducibility\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the humanities, as in all academic fields, being able to reproduce the analytical process is crucial. When you write your R code in scripts, you’re creating a record of every step in your analysis. This is like creating detailed footnotes or citations in a research paper - it allows others (or future you!) to follow your work exactly.\nUsing scripts also makes it easy to make changes and rerun your entire analysis, which is much more efficient than trying to remember and retype everything in the console.",

    "text": "4.3 Essential Quarto Concepts\n\n4.3.1 Editing Quarto Files: Source vs. Visual Editor\nQuarto documents can be edited in two modes: Source and Visual.\n\n\nSource Editor: This mode shows you the raw Markdown and YAML content of your document. It’s great for:\n\nPrecise control over your document’s structure\nEditing code chunks directly\nWorking with advanced Quarto features\n\n\n\nVisual Editor: This mode provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface, similar to word processors like Microsoft Word. It’s useful for:\n\nFormatting text without knowing Markdown syntax\nEasily inserting tables, images, and other elements\nCollaborating with team members who may not be familiar with Markdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Basics\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language used in Quarto documents. Here are some basic syntax examples:\n\n\n# Heading 1, ## Heading 2, ### Heading 3, etc. for headings\n\n*italic* or _italic_ for italic text\n\n\n**bold** or __bold__ for bold text\n\n\n- item for unordered lists\n\n1. item for ordered lists\n\n[link text](URL) for links\n\n\n![alt text](image.jpg) for images\n\nFor a more comprehensive guide, check out Quarto’s Markdown Basics.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Rendering\nRendering is the process of converting your Quarto document into its final output format (e.g., HTML, PDF, or Word). To render your document:\n\nClick the “Render” button in RStudio, or\nUse the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+K (Cmd+Shift+K on Mac)\n\nWhen you render, Quarto executes all the code in your document and combines the results with your text to create the final output.\n\n4.3.3 (Optional) Code Chunk Options\nCode chunks in Quarto can be customized using options. These options control how the code is executed and displayed. Here are some common options:\n```{r}\n#| label: chunk-name\n#| echo: true\n#| eval: true\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n# Your R code here\n```\n\n\nlabel: Gives the chunk a unique name\n\necho: Controls whether the code is displayed in the output (true/false)\n\neval: Determines if the code should be executed (true/false)\n\nwarning: Shows or hides warnings (true/false)\n\nmessage: Shows or hides messages (true/false)\n\nYou can set these options globally in the YAML header or for individual chunks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nUse code chunk options to control what your readers see. For example, you might hide code for complex calculations but show the results.",

Common functions that are useful for working with text are:\n\nDetecting text: str_detect(), str_count()\n\nExtracting text: str_extract(), str_extract_all()\n\nReplacing text: str_replace(), str_replace_all()\n\nRemoving text: str_remove(), str_remove_all()\n\n\nRegex (regular expressions) are powerful tools for pattern matching in strings. Here’s a breakdown of the regex used in our example:\n\n\n\"[[:punct:]]\": This pattern matches any punctuation character.\n\n\n[] defines a character set\n\n[:punct:] is a POSIX character class representing all punctuation\n\n\n\n\"\\\\d+\": This pattern matches one or more digits.\n\n\n\\\\d represents any digit (equivalent to [0-9])\n\n+ means “one or more” of the preceding element\n\n\n\n\"[^[:alnum:][:space:]]\": This pattern matches any character that is not alphanumeric or whitespace.\n\n\n^ inside [] means “not”\n\n[:alnum:] matches any alphanumeric character\n\n[:space:] matches any whitespace character\n\n\n\nUsing these patterns with str_replace_all(), we can effectively clean our text by removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters.\nExample:\n\nstr_replace_all(\"Hello, world! 123\", \"[[:punct:]]\", \"\")\n\n[1] \"Hello world 123\"\n\nstr_replace_all(\"Hello, world! 123\", \"\\\\d+\", \"\")\n\n[1] \"Hello, world! \"\n\nstr_replace_all(\"Hello, world! 123 @#$\", \"[^[:alnum:][:space:]]\", \"\")\n\n[1] \"Hello world 123 \"\n\n# Example of str_trim()\nstr_trim(\"  Hello, world!  \")\n\n[1] \"Hello, world!\"\n\n# Example of str_squish()\nstr_squish(\"Hello,   world!

The choice of which steps to apply depends on the specific goals of your analysis and the nature of your text data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Implications of Preprocessing\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial to carefully consider and document each preprocessing step you apply to your text data. These decisions can significantly impact your analysis results:\n\n\nInformation Loss: Some preprocessing steps (like removing punctuation or lowercasing) can remove potentially important information.\n\nAnalysis Bias: Certain preprocessing choices might inadvertently introduce bias into your analysis.\n\nInterpretability: Your preprocessing decisions affect how you can interpret your results later.\n\nReproducibility: Documenting your preprocessing steps is essential for others to reproduce or build upon your work.\n\nDomain Specificity: The appropriate preprocessing steps can vary depending on your field of study and the specific texts you’re analyzing.\n\nAlways think critically about why you’re applying each preprocessing step and how it might affect your analysis outcomes. When in doubt, it’s often helpful to try multiple preprocessing approaches and compare the results.",

    "text": "2 Online Help\nData science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and Posit Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\nIf you use Mastodon or Twitter/X, post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\nChatGPT is generally relatively okay with R questions, but it may hallucinate responses—it sometimes imagine packages that don’t exist and then give you answers with them. Think of it as glorified autocomplete. I’d encourage you to read the first few paragraphs here about a few important things to keep in mind when using ChatGPT, though.\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”). Also, since most of your R work will deal with {ggplot2}, it’s often easier to just search for that instead of the letter “r” (e.g. “ggplot scatterplot”).",

    "section": "3 Installation Guide",
    "text": "3 Installation Guide\n\n3.1 Install R\nFirst you need to install R itself (the engine).\n\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows: \n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 4.4.1) and download it.\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it. \n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\n3.2 Install RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it: \nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\n3.3 FAQs 常见安装问题\n\n打开RStudio，出现弹窗让我选择R的版本（如下图）:  这说明你的R的安装路径无法被RStudio自动找到，需要点击browse按钮手动选择R.exe的位置： 请找到并点击R安装文件夹(如文件名为R 4.4.1的文件夹)中的bin文件夹，即可看到R.exe，选中即可。\n报错消息中说缺少RTools: 请到RTools网站下载并安装RTools https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/\n\n\n\n3.4 Install tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter. \nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including {ggplot2}) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed. \nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\n3.5 Install tinytex (Optional, this is for rendering PDF files)\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced “lay-tek” or “lah-tex”; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the “ch” sound in “Bach”, but most people just say it as “k”—saying “layteks” is frowned on for whatever reason).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it’s a huge program—the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB! To make life easier, there’s an R package named {tinytex} that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere’s how to install {tinytex} so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install {tinytex} like you did above with {tidyverse}. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nThe end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.\n\nCredit: this installation guide was adpated from the guide by Dr Andrew Heiss at Georgia State University.",

It means “all columns”.\nThis gives you all the data in that specific row.\n\n\n\nIndividual Cells: Use [row_number, column_number] (e.g., books[1, 2]).\n\nThis gives you the value in a specific row and column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcessing the books Data Frame\n\n\n\n\n\nData frames are essentially just spread sheet tables. Our books data frame looks like this:\n\n\ntitle\nauthor\nyear\n\n\n\n1984\nOrwell\n1949\n\n\nPride and Prejudice\nAusten\n1813\n\n\nThe Great Gatsby\nFitzgerald\n1925\n\n\n\n\n\nbooks$title would give: 1984, Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby\n\n\nbooks[2, ] would give: Pride and Prejudice, Austen, 1813\n\n\nbooks[1, 2] would give: Orwell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Get a specific column\nbooks$title\n\n[1] \"1984\"                \"Pride and Prejudice\" \"The Great Gatsby\"   \n\n# Get a specific row\nbooks[2, ]\n\n                title author year\n2 Pride and Prejudice Austen 1813\n\n# Get a specific cell\nbooks[1, 2]\n\n[1] \"Orwell\"\n\n# Get a specific cell using row number and column name\nbooks[2, \"title\"] # Get the second title\n\n[1] \"Pride and Prejudice\"\n\n# Get the record based on a specific value\nbooks[books$author == \"Austen\", ] # Get all records by Austen\n\n                title author year\n2 Pride and Prejudice Austen 1813\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Nested Functions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line books[books$author == \"Austen\", ] might look complex, but let’s break it down:\n\n\nbooks$author: This part gets the author column from our books data frame.\n\nbooks$author == \"Austen\": This compares each author name to “Austen”.\n\n\nIt creates a list of TRUE/FALSE values (TRUE where the author is Austen, FALSE otherwise).\nFor example, if we had 3 books and only the second was by Austen, this would give: [FALSE, TRUE, FALSE]\n\n\n\nbooks[...]: This is like asking R to look inside the books data frame.\n\nbooks[books$author == \"Austen\", ]: This combines steps 2 and 3.\n\n\nIt tells R: “From the books data frame, give me all rows where the author is Austen”.\nThe comma at the end means “give me all columns for these rows”.\n\nThink of it like a librarian (R) searching through a catalog (the data frame):\n\nYou ask: “Can you find all books by Austen?”\nThe librarian checks each book’s author (TRUE/FALSE for Austen).\nThen returns all information about the books that matched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Data Based on Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example demonstrates a powerful technique called “filtering”:\n\nCreating a condition: books$author == \"Austen\" creates a logical vector (TRUE/FALSE) for each row where the author is Austen.\nUsing the condition: We use this vector inside the square brackets [ ] to select only those rows that meet our condition.\nSelecting columns: The comma after the condition (books [condition, ]) means “select all columns for these rows”.\n\nThis method allows you to extract specific records based on any condition you specify. For example:\n\nFind all books published after 1900: books[books$year &gt; 1900, ]\nFind all books with “War” in the title: books[grepl(“War”, books$title), ]\n\nFiltering is a crucial skill in data manipulation and analysis, allowing you to focus on specific subsets of your data.",
