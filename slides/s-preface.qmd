## Why Digital? {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Scale
- Analyze vast amounts of data
- Uncover patterns across large corpora
- Example: Google Books Ngram Viewer

### Speed
- Rapid processing of information
- Quick iteration of research hypotheses
- Example: Topic modeling on thousands of documents

### Visualization
- Complex data representation
- New insights through visual analysis
- Example: Network analysis of historical figures

### Collaboration
- Global research networks
- Interdisciplinary partnerships
- Example: Crowdsourced transcription projects

## Do Humanities Really Need Digital? {.smaller}

::: {.r-fit-text}
Let's discuss! ðŸ¤”
:::

::: {.incremental}
Form small groups and consider:

1. Traditional humanities research methods
2. Potential benefits of digital approaches
3. Possible drawbacks or concerns

Share your thoughts with the class (5 minutes for discussion, 5 minutes for sharing)

## Digital Humanities in Action {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
### Text Analysis
- Distant reading of literary corpora
- Stylometry and authorship attribution

### Network Analysis
- Mapping historical social networks
- Visualizing cultural connections

### Spatial Analysis
- GIS in archaeology and history
- Digital mapping of literary landscapes
:::

## Hands-on Experience: Text Analysis {.smaller}

Let's try a simple text analysis using R!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)

# Sample text (first paragraph of "Pride and Prejudice")
text <- "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters."

# Tokenize the text
words <- tibble(text = text) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

# Count word frequencies
word_freq <- words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word)

# Display top 10 words
head(word_freq, 10)

# Create a simple bar plot
ggplot(head(word_freq, 10), aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Words in Pride and Prejudice Excerpt",
       x = "Word", y = "Frequency")
```

## Ethics in Digital Humanities {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
1. Data privacy and consent
   - How do we ethically use and share digital archives?
2. Bias in algorithms and datasets
   - Are our digital tools reinforcing existing biases?
3. Digital divide and accessibility
   - Who has access to DH tools and resources?
4. Long-term preservation of digital artifacts
   - How do we ensure the longevity of digital scholarship?

How can we address these ethical concerns in our research?
:::

## Conclusion and Next Steps {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Recap of key concepts:
  - DH as interdisciplinary field
  - Benefits of digital approaches
  - Ethical considerations
- Preview of next class: Introduction to R programming
- Questions?
