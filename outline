1. Introduction to Text Analysis and Preprocessing
   - Basic concepts: corpus, document, token
   - Preprocessing techniques:
     - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization
     - Stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization
   - Simple analysis:
     - Word frequency, n-grams, word clouds
   - Introduction to Bag of Words (basic word count)

3. Sentiment Analysis
   - Lexicon-based approaches:
     - Using pre-built sentiment lexicons
     - Creating custom lexicons
   - Basic machine learning approaches:
     - Using simple BoW for classification
   - Applications:
     - Analyzing sentiment in literary texts
     - Tracking emotional arcs in narratives
   - Limitations of simple approaches (segue to next chapter)

2. Advanced Text Representation Methods
   - Bag of Words (BoW) in depth:
     - Document-term matrix
     - TF-IDF
   - Word and Document Embeddings:
     - Word2Vec, GloVe
     - Doc2Vec
   - Revisiting sentiment analysis with advanced representations
   - Applications:
     - Document similarity
     - Author style analysis
     - Diachronic language analysis

4. Topic Modeling
   - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
   - Interpreting and visualizing topics
   - Applications in humanities research
   - Other topic modeling techniques and variations
